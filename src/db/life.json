But for some of those migrants, the COVID-19 pandemic meant a forceful return after living on a day-to-day basis, unable to afford rent anymore. Today, they\u2019re waiting for the quarantine to be over to start a life, again, from scratch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A 27-year-old woman from Barquisimeto, Lara State (who asked to remain anonymous), says that she left for C\u00facuta, Colombia, during the first days of January 2020. Her aunt and uncle had already moved there in mid-2019 and they made a living teaching acting. The young woman, who was an Arts major at the Universidad Central Lisandro Alvarado and was only missing her thesis, decided to leave and try her luck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She was able to work as an arts teacher for only two months. Her employers had to send her home because of the pandemic, and she didn\u2019t have savings to pay for her room, so she had no choice but to return to Venezuela. Her aunt and uncle were left without pesos too, even though they had spent more time in Colombia, and were also forced to leave. \u201cIf we ate, we couldn\u2019t pay rent. If we paid a month\u2019s rent, then we couldn\u2019t eat. We returned to Venezuela because at least we have our own place here,\u201d says the young lady\u2019s aunt, who requested to remain anonymous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On April 29<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the three of them entered Venezuelan soil. The government that expelled them through absurd economic policies, received them with mismanagement. The young Larense and her aunt and uncle, had to spend six nights in the San Antonio del T\u00e1chira bus terminal, near the border with Colombia, waiting for a bus from the Maduro administration to take them to Barquisimeto.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On May 6<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, they reached their assigned shelter: the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Villa Bolivariana.<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> All three of them spent 14 days in lockdown, where the young woman says that things \u201cwere unbearable\u201d. She says that they got locked inside an apartment, and the door would open only when food was brought in, \u201cfood that you wouldn\u2019t give to a dog.\u201d She says that the apartment had no running water (rationed for one hour a day) and the place was shared with people. She also says that Cuban doctors would go by every day to check on people and would recommend medicine to those with any disease.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, they\u2019re waiting for the quarantine to be over to start a life, again, from scratch.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After officers from the National Guard allowed them to leave, she was able to see her mother after three months, a moment she says she\u2019ll never forget.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although her love for her family can be a big reason to stay, she says that she can\u2019t. Ever since she came back, she\u2019s been working as a private tutor, because the pandemic also forced schools to close. What each parent pays for their child is barely enough for her to live, and this encourages her to flee again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The girl is now waiting for the COVID-19 pandemic to be over, or for a vaccine to come out. Her first goal is to hand in her thesis and graduate; she\u2019ll then leave, this time for Spain. \u201cIt\u2019s a more stable country and with less xenophobia,\u201d she says.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also Expelled by South America<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00c1ngel, a 27-year-old from T\u00e1chira State, is on the same side of the curb. In 2017, he left for Lima, Peru, with his girlfriend. After working at a cake factory where he was forced to handle hot batter without the proper tools, he decided to return in December 2019.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When he left, \u00c1ngel had to quit his 7<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> semester in Animal Production Engineering at the Universidad Nacional Experimental del T\u00e1chira. When he returned to San Crist\u00f3bal, capital of the state, he told himself that he\u2019d finish it, not counting on a short circuit that would burn down the area where the university holds the entire student body database. The staff couldn\u2019t reinstate him because they didn\u2019t know which subjects he had passed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The area where \u00c1ngel lives has power cuts for six to eight hours each day, and in January and February he experienced (once again) what it\u2019s like to spend two days in line to fill up a tank of gas.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, in March, he decided to leave again, hoping for the pandemic to be over soon so that he can go and get a job in the United States. Latin America, to him, is the same as Venezuela: bad wages, work exploitation and xenophobia, a trade of old problems for new ones. \u201cIn America, you break your back working, but you get paid well. In Peru and those countries, you work hard, and your salary is just enough for food and rent.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Leaving isn\u2019t easy, and neither is coming back to an old reality that you now have to endure indefinitely because of the pandemic<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2236,"featured_media":81031,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":""},"categories":[1007],"tags":[932],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/IMG-8012-scaled.jpg","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.0.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Forced to Return\u2026 Only to Leave Again | Caracas Chronicles<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow\" \/>\n<meta name=\"googlebot\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"bingbot\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/07\/17\/forced-to-return-only-to-leave-again\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Forced to Return\u2026 Only to Leave Again | Caracas Chronicles\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Leaving isn\u2019t easy, and neither is coming back to an old reality that you now have to endure indefinitely because of the pandemic\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/07\/17\/forced-to-return-only-to-leave-again\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Caracas Chronicles\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:publisher\" content=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CaracasChronicles\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2020-07-17T18:58:23+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:modified_time\" content=\"2020-07-17T18:50:52+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/IMG-8012-scaled.jpg\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:width\" content=\"2560\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:height\" content=\"1600\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:creator\" content=\"@CaracasChron\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:site\" content=\"@CaracasChron\" \/>\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/#website\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/\",\"name\":\"Caracas Chronicles\",\"description\":\"Making Venezuela make sense\",\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"SearchAction\",\"target\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/?s={search_term_string}\",\"query-input\":\"required name=search_term_string\"}],\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\"},{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/07\/17\/forced-to-return-only-to-leave-again\/#primaryimage\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/IMG-8012-scaled.jpg\",\"width\":2560,\"height\":1600},{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/07\/17\/forced-to-return-only-to-leave-again\/#webpage\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/07\/17\/forced-to-return-only-to-leave-again\/\",\"name\":\"Forced to Return\\u2026 Only to Leave Again | Caracas Chronicles\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/#website\"},\"primaryImageOfPage\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/07\/17\/forced-to-return-only-to-leave-again\/#primaryimage\"},\"datePublished\":\"2020-07-17T18:58:23+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2020-07-17T18:50:52+00:00\",\"author\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/#\/schema\/person\/29ee172891c198a1130ba1bcda5fa5db\"},\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"ReadAction\",\"target\":[\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/07\/17\/forced-to-return-only-to-leave-again\/\"]}]},{\"@type\":[\"Person\"],\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/#\/schema\/person\/29ee172891c198a1130ba1bcda5fa5db\",\"name\":\"Daisy Galaviz\",\"image\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/#personlogo\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/78aa5c576ccdffc48e3eb9ebdc461386?s=96&d=mm&r=g\",\"caption\":\"Daisy Galaviz\"},\"description\":\"Journalist for El Pitazo and Monitor de V\\u00edctimas (Runrunes).

If you pay $150, you can get on a bus to any part of the country,\u201d a 48-year-old Venezuelan who is stuck at the border told us recently, although he can\u2019t afford to bribe the Venezuelan officials to let him through.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He\u2019s one of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/lta.reuters.com\/articulo\/salud-coronavirus-colombia-migracion-idLTAKBN23N061\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tens of thousands<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Venezuelans returning home amid the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the economic, political, and humanitarian crises in Venezuela. Many returning migrants slip through unofficial border crossings, some having to pay bribes to cross, risking spreading the virus as they return home. Those who enter through official crossings face an ineffective system at the border that may spread the disease instead of halting it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The man we interviewed left his hometown in Anzo\u00e1tegui to pursue a better life in Bogot\u00e1 less than a year ago. But the pandemic crushed his plans, since lockdown measures obliterated the informal sector where he worked and he could no longer afford rent and food. He walked for 30 days to the border and crossed into Venezuela through one of the hundreds of illegal crossings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has claimed that when returnees arrive to Venezuela \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/VTVcanal8\/status\/1271219754011852800\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they\u2019re free, have dignity and are humans again<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d He clearly hasn\u2019t visited the border these days.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A government <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1TahFxAqCYf3h-MTY-mwddWWbOhwFWoUS\/view\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">protocol<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> considers anyone entering the country as a suspected COVID-19 case, and requires testing and then staying in quarantine at the border before continuing the journey.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In theory, the screening and testing protocol could help identify, isolate, and treat returning Venezuelans with COVID-19, but delays and problems with the testing protocol could instead magnify transmission. Local news outlets <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/lanacionweb.com\/frontera\/ocho-dias-a-la-intemperie-retornados-y-migrantes-internos\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have reported<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the people waiting for tests have to fend for themselves. The man we talked to, who was able to get tested and then was transferred to a quarantine shelter after more than a week, said the people waiting for testing slept on the street without distancing or masks, filled their bottles with rainwater and waited to be admitted without official support.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People waiting for testing slept on the street without distancing or masks, filled their bottles with rainwater and waited to be admitted without official support.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some aid workers said there were delays because the tests are in short supply. In other cases, people who cross through the long, porous border between Colombia and Venezuela simply aren\u2019t tested.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Waiting to be tested isn\u2019t the only time returnees may be at risk; returning Venezuelans with a negative antibody rapid test are required to isolate in a shelter. This makes sense because the rapid antibody test used to screen them can be falsely negative during the early and most contagious time of infection.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this also means that some people entering the quarantine shelters may be infected and, without adequate protections, could easily spread COVID-19 to others. Many quarantine shelters, which range from hotels to stadiums to abandoned schools, are overcrowded and people face unsanitary conditions, including difficulty accessing water. This has made social distancing and handwashing, two basic measures to prevent COVID-19 from spreading, nearly impossible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On July 8th, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zjXY-ffzUsc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maduro said<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> people crossing through illegal passageways were \u201ccontaminating their communities\u201d and \u201ckilling their families\u201d.

This stigmatization and intimidation of an already vulnerable population undermines the testing efforts.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plight of Venezuelan returnees illustrates the desperate situation that the Maduro government has created. The returnees originally fled a repressive regime that contributed to a man-made humanitarian emergency at home only to face vulnerability abroad, which has worsened with the pandemic. They\u2019re now returning to inflammatory rhetoric and even more precarious conditions in a country that had a collapsed health system <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hrw.org\/report\/2019\/04\/04\/venezuelas-humanitarian-emergency\/large-scale-un-response-needed-address-health\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">even before the pandemic hit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eltiempo.com\/mundo\/venezuela\/que-pasa-con-los-venezolanos-que-buscan-regresar-a-su-pais-505094\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">continuous flow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of returnees making their way from various parts of the continent, the conditions at the border, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.migracioncolombia.gov.co\/noticias\/nuevas-restricciones-en-corredores-humanitarios-por-parte-de-venezuela\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">restrictions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the Maduro government has imposed on the number of people who can enter the country through official access points, stories like the one we heard are likely to become more common.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To limit the spread of COVID-19 in Venezuela and protect the rights of people returning, Venezuela needs to provide prompt and appropriate testing and proper conditions in quarantine shelters at the border. But given the hostility the Maduro administration has shown toward returnees, the government is unlikely to take the necessary steps without strong international pressure.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their efforts to push for a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hrw.org\/news\/2020\/05\/26\/venezuela-urgent-aid-needed-combat-covid-19\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">large scale and apolitical UN-led humanitarian response in Venezuela<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, United Nations Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and his humanitarian team at its highest levels, as well as donor governments, should pressure Venezuelan authorities to end their stigmatizing rhetoric and accept a border protocol that respects citizens\u2019 rights; with international humanitarian aid that is distributed by an independent third party. Meanwhile, Latin American governments should ensure that Venezuelans in their countries have access to legal status and proper health care there, so they don\u2019t feel forced to return to Venezuela\u2019s desperate reality. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The vulnerability that drove many Venezuelans to leave their home country has increased because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

He had always planned to do his medical residency program abroad and then go back to his native Bol\u00edvar, in southern Venezuela. By the time he graduated, he still wanted to go abroad for his residency, but coming back wasn\u2019t part of the plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Something that cemented his decision to leave took place shortly after graduation. Medical doctors in Venezuela are required to do a rural year, and in Bol\u00edvar, they get to choose according to how well they did in medical school. Jos\u00e9 graduated first of his class, meaning he should\u2019ve had first pick regarding where he was going to do his rural. However, graduates with acquaintances in the government office chose before Jos\u00e9. He realized that having the right connections would always overrule performance in chavismo\u2019s Venezuela.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After considering Italy and Spain, due to his family roots, Jos\u00e9 started to research Germany as an option. There, he would have no trouble finding a job after his residency. The biggest obstacle would be the language, but always eager to learn new things, Jos\u00e9 started to study German during his rural year. He left for Germany in April, 2017.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After he arrived in the city of Wesel, he took an assessment test, where he was placed at the B1 level. He started an intensive course an hour away, in D\u00fcsseldorf, in which he felt terribly challenged as he had to interpret texts in German at a level he wasn\u2019t used to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As he did all the paperwork necessary to get a work permit as a doctor, he was able to find a job at the Red Cross. However, Jos\u00e9 had to take a medical language test for which he studied alone. He did great, and he now had a permit that allowed him to stay in Germany. He could only work for two years, and only in North-Rhine Westphalia.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_80998\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"max-width: 982px;\" itemprop=\"image\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/ImageObject\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/TADY-Jose.jpeg\" data-fancybox=\"image\"><img data-attachment-id=\"80998\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/07\/12\/tales-of-a-displaced-youth-jose\/tady-jose\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/TADY-Jose.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"972,1296\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Tales of a Displaced Youth: Jos\u00e9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/TADY-Jose-225x300.jpeg\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/TADY-Jose-768x1024.jpeg\" class=\"wp-image-80998 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/TADY-Jose.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"972\" height=\"1296\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/TADY-Jose.jpeg 972w, https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/TADY-Jose-225x300.jpeg 225w, https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/TADY-Jose-768x1024.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 972px) 100vw, 972px\" \/><\/a><figcaption itemprop=\"caption\"><h6>&#8220;As he did all the paperwork necessary to get a work permit as a doctor, he was able to find a job at the Red Cross.

As the days went on, his stress increased, until suddenly, all the places started to respond. Jos\u00e9 went to four interviews, and the four hospitals offered him the job. He started to work as a medical doctor in June 2018.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this time, Jos\u00e9 got to see how difficult it was to make friends in Germany. While he always was treated with respect, German culture is a lot more reserved. His colleagues wouldn\u2019t consider him a friend for a long time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He waited until he felt more comfortable with the medical language and the German medical system to apply for the permanent validation of his degree. He would have to take a comprehensive exam, in which he would be interrogated by a panel of three doctors for an entire day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2019, Jos\u00e9 was notified about the date of his test only a month before he had to take it and the place appointed would be M\u00fcnster, infamous for having the toughest evaluators, with a very low approval rate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jos\u00e9 had to review six years of med school in German, and would later remember this as one of the hardest months since he left Venezuela.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The day of the test came and Jos\u00e9, along with four other doctors, were interrogated for over ten hours. Jos\u00e9\u2019s preparation and his German skills didn\u2019t go unnoticed and he was one of the two who passed. Now, he plans to keep studying Internal Medicine. In the future, he\u2019d like to set up a consult where people from different nationalities feel welcomed, and where he can make use of both his medical knowledge and his language skills. Germany is a very different place from what he had seen in Venezuela. Slowly but surely, he has earned the trust of his colleagues, and he has developed true friendships. He doesn\u2019t know what the future will bring, but he knows that he is in the right place for him, and for whatever may come.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Leaving your country of origin to look for a new job is quite the task, especially for those who have to learn a new language.

Indeed, this demographer would die on the hill of Cajigal having overestimated the Venezuelan population in 1838. Worse, according to the incensed demographer, Cajigal\u2019s overestimate distorted population counts for the rest of the 19th century. To believe Cajigal and his unwitting acolytes, the demographer argues, is to swallow the improbable conclusion that the Venezuelan population grew faster in the 19th century than in the early 20th century. An unlikely story, he says.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eulogies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Professor Baptista have <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">extolled<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> his accomplishments as an economist, economic historian, intellectual historian, teacher, colleague, and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all-around \u201chigh-level thinker.\u201d<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demographer proposed a correction. The correction isn\u2019t trivial: without it, Venezuela held close to 2.5 million inhabitants at the turn of the 20th century; with it, a mere 2 million. Those five hundred thousand souls will make a big difference in your study of the evolution of GDP per capita.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But wait. Another demographer\u2014this one Venezuelan, Julio P\u00e1ez C\u00e9lis\u2014<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/catalog.hathitrust.org\/Record\/101155006?type%5B%5D=author&amp;lookfor%5B%5D=p%C3%A1ez%20c%C3%A9lis&amp;ft=\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">disagrees<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Projecting backward from the much sounder censuses of the mid-20th century, using interpolation together with data on births and deaths and migration, produces a figure close to 2.5 million. You check his work, do your own calculations, and find that perhaps the 19th century adventurers weren\u2019t so wrong after all: you estimate 2,475,251 inhabitants for 1900.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This task has taken ages, and you\u2019re only up to the Cipriano Castro administration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately for all students of Venezuelan political economy, somebody else already did this work, along with dozens of similar yet even harder tasks: Asdr\u00fabal Baptista, who died last month at the age of 73.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cinco8.com\/periodismo\/asdrubal-baptista-del-petroleo-a-la-historia-de-venezuela-y-de-vuelta\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eulogies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Professor Baptista have <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/prodavinci.com\/asdrubal-baptista-la-mirada-de-un-visionario\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">extolled<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> his accomplishments as an economist, economic historian, intellectual historian, teacher, colleague, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/prodavinci.com\/asdrubal-baptista-troconis\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all-around \u201chigh-level thinker.\u201d<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We\u2019ve heard of his pithy synthesis of economic thought from Adam Smith through John Maynard Keynes and of his \u201cvisionary\u201d views on what to do with Venezuelan oil.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I\u2019ve missed a celebration of his equally vital work as collator and curator of historical data on the Venezuelan economy. Baptista\u2019s essential tome of tables, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bibliofep.fundacionempresaspolar.org\/publicaciones\/libros\/bases-cuantitativas-de-la-econom%C3%ADa-venezolana-1830-2002\/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bases cuantitativas de la econom\u00eda venezolana<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, tells us not only how the Venezuelan population changed\u2014that\u2019s merely Table 1\u2014but also how the labor force grew, how the economy expanded and contracted, how each economic sector rose and fell, how prices inflated, and how income was distributed, to name just a few of the book\u2019s many gems. Each of those tables required wrangling with sources at least as slippery and contradictory as Cajigal and Codazzi and P\u00e1ez C\u00e9lis.

The agency didn\u2019t provide any specific reasons for the measure.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new guidelines affect students who are in the U.S. under temporary student visas. They can be either in an academic program like a bachelor\u2019s degree or language training (under an F-1 visa) or in a nonacademic, vocational program (under an M-1 visa). This means more than 1 million students, according to data from the 2018-2019 school year in the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.iie.org\/en\/Research-and-Insights\/Open-Doors\/Data\/International-Students\/Enrollment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Institute of International Education<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That number includes about seven thousand Venezuelans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The changes come as COVID-19 cases in the U.S. surpass 3 million and institutions <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/education\/2020\/06\/22\/coronavirus-reopening-college-fall-2020\/3210719001\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">plan the modality<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of their fall semester. Some had begun to roll out their reopening plans, which included a combination of online and in-person classes. Others considered moving to a fully online course load and now face pressure to offer in-person courses so international students can stay in the country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regular visa limitations prevent international students from taking classes exclusively online. The agency made exemptions at the beginning of the pandemic lockdowns but only for the spring and summer semesters. Now, if schools remain online, students would technically have two options: return to their home countries and take classes online there, or transfer to an institution that offers a hybrid or completely in-person semester. In practice, however, many countries are still offering a limited number of flights and seeing a rise in the coronavirus cases. Flights from the U.S. are even banned from entering the European Union at the moment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Venezuelan students have extra roadblocks. There are few to no flights to Venezuela.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Venezuelan students have extra roadblocks. There are few to no flights to Venezuela, returning migrants face quarantine imposed by the regime, and the country\u2019s crisis would force them to study with slow internet, lack of sanitary precautions, and economic instability.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Elvira Blanco, the news added more uncertainty and anxiety to that already caused by the pandemic. She\u2019s 29 years old and working on a doctorate in Latin American studies in Columbia University, a private school in New York. As of July 8th, the university hadn\u2019t announced how they\u2019d be working in the fall but said it was working to accommodate its international students.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elvira is at a point in her academic program where she only has to teach, not take classes. She had considered going to Spain with her family and teaching from there if the semester was set to be online. But that plan isn\u2019t easy to achieve amid the pandemic and ICE\u2019s announcement added the pressure of potential deportation. She\u2019s also scared that if she\u2019s deported, she could lose her visa. Her doctorate is her source of income, and losing it could mean losing her scholarship and financial stability, but having the university open completely would mean putting students back in classrooms, and asking the international students who left when lockdowns started to come back from their home countries, increasing the risk of infections. Even with a hybrid model, she has to teach in person, and she fears the only result is that she\u2019ll contract the virus.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She considered returning to Venezuela when the pandemic started, but with a collapsed healthcare system and the increasing number of cases (only reported by the regime), she decided to stay. Returning now is one of her last options.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daniel Nu\u00f1ez, 21, is in a similar situation. He\u2019s preparing to start a Master\u2019s degree in biomedical engineering at the University of Florida in August, after getting his bachelor\u2019s in materials engineering this spring. UF, a public university, announced on Wednesday that it would make sure its reopening plan includes enough classes for international students to comply with the ICE guidelines.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though his family is still there and \u201cit will always be an option,\u201d he views returning as going back to what he tried to escape by migrating in the first place.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university\u2019s announcement brought Daniel a wave of calm. He had envisioned three scenarios for his fall semester. If UF only had online classes, he could apply for an Optional Practical Training (OPT), an employment permission that would allow him to work for a few months, and find a job (in regular circumstances, international students can only work through work-study or an internship program). If UF provided enough in-person classes for him to remain in the country, he would take them and stay. If those two didn\u2019t happen, he could travel to Spain or Argentina where friends could take him in for a few months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Returning to Venezuela isn&#8217;t a plan.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though his family is still there and \u201cit will always be an option,\u201d he views returning as going back to what he tried to escape by migrating in the first place, four years ago. He could go for a few months while the pandemic dies down, but he&#8217;d rather go to a country where he has more opportunities to study and work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oriana Mejias is also weighing her options. She&#8217;s working on a doctorate in Latin American culture in the City University of New York. Like UF, CUNY is public so it depends on the decisions of the federal and state governments, and Oriana must wait for New York officials and the university to decide the modality of the fall semester. If the semester is online, her options are also limited. Her passport has expired and her only way to stay out of the U.S. is going to Santiago, Chile, where she had lived before and started an immigration process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if institutions provide enough in-person courses for students to stay, ICE\u2019s announcement also said that, if schools start the semester with in-person classes but are later forced to move online, the students won\u2019t be allowed to take more than one online course and will have to leave the country\u2014or seek alternatives to stay as nonimmigrant students.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On July 8th, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.harvard.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/content\/sevp_filing.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sued<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the Department of Homeland Security and ICE. The schools argue that ICE didn\u2019t give institutions enough warning or time to adjust to the guidelines and, hence, violated a federal statute. This could lead a judge to block ICE\u2019s decision to eliminate the exemptions, or push the agencies to remove them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the meantime, international students continue to wait for their schools to announce their modality, and evaluate where to go now, what to do with their housing if they need to leave, or how to return to their countries in the middle of a pandemic.

Since access to actual figures of our crisis is the gateway towards national progress, and in the face of a silent state that harasses and persecutes the independent media, the Venezuelan academia took it upon itself to discover just what are the actual seeds of economic disparity in the nation, and what are the main challenges of making a living in our very hostile reality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result of that brainstorm is the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.proyectoencovi.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ENCOVI project<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Starting in 2014, with Venezuela already well into social conflict, ENCOVI, which in Spanish stands for \u201cNational Poll on Life Conditions of the Venezuelan Population,\u201d is an effort by three Venezuelan universities (Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Andr\u00e9s Bello, Universidad Central de Venezuela, and Universidad Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar) focusing on poverty, the effectivity of social programs (or \u201cmissions,\u201d as they\u2019re called by chavismo), the particular characteristics of Venezuelan households, physical and mental health of the people, mortality and birth rates, the state of maternity health and childhood vaccination programs, emigration, education, nutrition, safety at work and on the streets, the employment rate and the conditions of public services and housing across the nation. The 2020 edition of the report, however, is only signed by Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Andr\u00e9s Bello.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The general deterioration of our crisis is evident and at the forefront of the 2019-2020 study, when many of the issues attacking Venezuelans degenerated into a humanitarian crisis. After research conducted from November 2019 to March 2020, the ENCOVI team (coordinated by Anita Freitez, a very experienced scholar in the area of demographic studies) polled 9,932 Venezuelan households (the initial goal, curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic, was of 16,920), taking advantage of technology in the reach of its questionnaire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is, basically, an independent actor doing a job that the government should be doing and sharing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>A Deep Demographic Change<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Venezuela is part of that club of countries of the former Soviet sphere or Africa which see their populations shrinking because of migration. We are 28.4 million people because about 5 million of us are abroad; by 2011, the year of the last national census, we had surpassed the barrier of 30 million people. But the decrease is also affected by the increase in mortality rate and the fall of the birth rate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Migration made us not only fewer but older: the exodus of young people pushed the proportion of 60 years old and older from 10% in 2015 to 12% in 2020. We have more senior citizens, more fragile in terms of health and productivity; our society is, therefore, less able to produce wealth and more in need of different ways of assistance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And there\u2019s this thing about our <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demographic bonus<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, that window of opportunity in the life of a nation when it has the best combination of ages to launch a collective jump into development. After decades of having plenty of children and teens in the second half of the 20th century, we were entering this window in 2000, and it looked as if it would last 40 years. ENCOVI shows the demographic change killed our demographic bonus; it ended in 2015. The measures by the chavista regime forced so many young people to emigrate that the good balance among ages we had before the humanitarian emergency started.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Migration made us not only fewer but older.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Venezuelan society after 20 years of chavismo looks like this: those who were born between 2015 and 2020 will live 3.7 years less than was previously predicted by the state; the child mortality rate is at 1980s levels, 26 per 1,000; more than 500,000 households live in <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ranchos<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, with at least three people per room (when they have rooms at all). Just 1 out of 4 homes has running water every day. Just 1 out of 10 homes has power every day.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are a smaller, poorer society with a falling purchasing power that limits the market for almost everything, and our social fabric is unraveling, with more and more households depending on one person, more commonly an older woman.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enter the combination of pandemic-related confinement measures and fuel shortage: unemployment rose 6.9% due to this, and 43% of households polled by ENCOVI report loss of income of employment since March.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Straight to the Last Place in the Region\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ENCOVI survey\u2014which was carried out before the pandemic hit\u2014shows that 79.3% of Venezuelan families can\u2019t afford the basic food basket (50 food products) and 96.2% can\u2019t afford the basic basket (the basic food basket plus 312 other basic needs and services). The number of Venezuelan families that simply can\u2019t afford a basic living standard has been going up since 2012, two years before Venezuela entered a recession and way before the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/International_sanctions_during_the_Venezuelan_crisis#:&shy;:text=On%2028%20January%2C%20the%20United,the%202019%20Venezuelan%20presidential%20crisis.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">economic sanctions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> came into play.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But being poor doesn\u2019t only mean that you and your family don&#8217;t have enough money for food, but also that your living conditions are way below standard. This is the reality of 6 out of every 10 Venezuelan families. This number has also been going up since, at least, 2014 and places Venezuela as the poorest country in Latin America and the Caribbean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This doesn\u2019t quite shock us. Not because the government wants Venezuelans to be poor, but wants them to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2018\/01\/12\/limits-chavismos-strategy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">depend on the state<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And, for that, it helps if they\u2019re poor. But now that shortages of basic goods have met hyperinflation and PDVSA has collapsed, the government can\u2019t provide for everyone anymore. Still, to date, ENCOVI shows that as of 2019 public non-wage transfers represent 25.3% of total family income and that 92% of households were part of the CLAP program and received a box at some point.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To break the cycle of poverty, Venezuelan households need to have the means to support themselves through <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.oecd.org\/statistics\/job-quality.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">high-quality jobs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, meaning relatively well-paid formal jobs in good working environments. However, as ENCOVI shows, members of poor families have less than favorable conditions to compete for a high-quality job. The average age of the heads of households is between 46 and 54 years old and, at most, 4 out of every 10 have a high school or higher education diploma.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though it\u2019s true that ENCOVI shows that the economically active population has remained unchanged, it\u2019s\u2014to date\u2014the lowest in the region. Also, close to half (45%) of the economically active Venezuelans work on their own (a number that came to 31% in 2014), mostly in retail. Hence, they lack all the benefits of a formally employed worker (such as food vouchers and labor benefits). And when the worker is forced to stop working due to health issues or an unexpected pandemic, the worker and his or her family (of between 2 and 4 members) is left without an income to fall back on.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>The Extent of Food (In)Security<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, the ENCOVI analysis of the situation of food insecurity in Venezuela includes two new sections: the effects of the pandemic, and the consumption of flour, rice, eggs, and beef according to economic class. The poll analyzes food insecurity through a conceptual basis (worrying to maintain food supply, adjusting budgets and limiting the quality and quantity of food portions at home) and through access to food,\u00a0 anthropometric measurements of children under 5 years old, malnutrition by gender and economic class, and data comparisons with the region.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report also shows that access to food isn\u2019t necessarily linked to income.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, the poll shows higher levels of food insecurity at homes compared to the ENCOVI 2018 analysis: 79% of homes report lack of a healthy diet (which reaches 83% during the pandemic, compared to the 69% reported during 2018); 49% of adults report not always eating when hungry (compared to 43% in 2018) and 34% of adults report eating only once a day or spending whole days without eating (compared to the 30% in 2018). Currently, 87% of adults are worried food will run out at homes (compared to 84% in 2018) and 57% report effectively running out of food (compared to 54% in 2018). During the pandemic, only 7% of homes haven\u2019t worried about food supply.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to highlight the comparison between the 2018 poll and the data provided by the 2019-2020 analysis to understand the growth of food insecurity throughout the country. In 2018, it showed 25% of low food insecurity, 31% of moderate food insecurity, and 32% of severe food insecurity. In 2019-2020 the data shows a significant rise in moderate food insecurity, reaching 36%, and severe food insecurity, reaching 33%. In short: 3 out of every 4 households (69%) report moderate and severe food insecurity since 2019.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The survey\u2019s new indicator, which analyzes the food groups eaten according to economic class (and shows the access to flour, rice, eggs, and beef), shows abysmal differences in the consumption of protein between high and lower economic classes. Venezuelans with high income eat 5 times more meat than those with lower income, and 3 times more eggs; highlighting that inequality shows 30% of nutritional differences depending on social status. Lower-income families have carbohydrate-based diets, which results in the national average consumption of protein of only 34.3% of the required level.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But regardless of economic status, the report also shows that access to food isn\u2019t necessarily linked to income, as it also shows the general population\u2019s consumption of food, showing that those with the highest rates are barely above the 2,000-calorie standard. This shows that an equitative distribution of food would barely fulfill the baseline of 2,000 calories per person per day, which highlights a generalized and structural growth of poverty and food access across the country.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The nutritional state of children under 5 years old also shows some concerning results, especially when compared to the region. 166,000 children qualify as malnourished, per their weight indicator according to their age. Venezuela\u2019s data shows a closer comparison to countries from Central America than to the South American region. Venezuela\u2019s 8% of child malnourishment worsens the region\u2019s reported average data. But the most worrisome data shown in the poll highlights the 639,000 children who suffer from chronic malnutrition, 30.3% that shows a significant difference between Chile\u2019s 1.8% in 2014, Colombia\u2019s 12.7% in 2016, and Peru\u2019s 13.1% in 2016.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Migration: Draining the Country of Human Resources\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ENCOVI shows that 19% of Venezuelan households reported that at least one of their members left the country between 2014 and 2019. This is in line with an increase in the number of households that report having members abroad, and in the number of family members within a household who have emigrated. The survey also shows an increased gender gap. Women comprised the majority of migrants up until 2015. The last five years have reversed those percentages to the point where men were the majority in the 2017 ENCOVI survey. The 2019-2020 survey shows 54% of migrants are men.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of age, this year\u2019s survey shows a drop in Venezuelan migrants between the ages of 15-29. With 49% they remain the largest group of migrants, but this is a 9% drop from 2018. Instead, migrants ages 30-49 increased from 2018 to 2019.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of Venezuelan migrants continue to leave seeking jobs or having one secured, but the percentage increased from 67% in 2017 to 82.8% in 2019-2020. Also, the second most common reason for leaving in 2017 was \u201cother\u201d. In 2019-2020, it was \u201cfamily reunification\u201d. In addition, 30% of households with members abroad reported receiving remittances\u2014especially those led by women facing poverty. In 2019, more Venezuelans 60 and older were the ones receiving remittances.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the report, before the pandemic, 4% of recent migrants considered returning. The number can be higher now, but ENCOVI expects emigration will slow down yet not stop after the pandemic, given that the majority goes abroad because they can\u2019t find jobs in the country.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Education, a Shadow of What It Was<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ENCOVI estimates that 1.7 million people in the 3 to 24-year-old demographic have left the country, which reduces pressure on the demand for education. The attendance rate in young adults aged 18 to 24 dropped to 25%, compared to 47% in 2014. In teens between 12 to 17, the attendance rate is 85%. The attendance rate in the 18-24 demographic has been steadily declining since 2016.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around half of the more vulnerable population can\u2019t complete 12 years of school or graduate, which would help in some way to reduce the risks of remaining in poverty.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, education coverage has dropped by half from that year: it was 48% in 2018. ENCOVI estimates that there are 3,136,000 people between 18 to 24 years old still residing in the country, out of which only 775,000 are attending school, versus 2,282,000 who don\u2019t.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Out of 7.8 million children in the country, from 3 to 17 years old, 40% report difficulties to attend school, for problems with water supply (23%), blackouts (17%), no food at home (16%), lack of transport (7%), or lack of teachers (18%).\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In conclusion, around half of the more vulnerable population can\u2019t complete 12 years of school or graduate, which would help in some way to reduce the risks of remaining in poverty. There\u2019s a huge step back in education for the population between 18 to 24 years old, the COVID-19 lockdown will deepen inequalities and those who don\u2019t have access to new technologies or lack the appropriate conditions for learning at home will be hit the hardest.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>The Harder Questions<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The diagnostic shown by the ENCOVI survey is, of course, a discouraging addition to what we\u2019ve been able to learn about the country through academic studies and journalism regarding the state of political institutions and the economy\u2014there\u2019s no single number issued by the government that can be relied upon.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The large scale collapse of\u00a0 Venezuela provides a somber reality today, but an even more chilling picture of the future. Chavismo destroyed the economy, our internal capacity to produce food and basic services, it ravaged the oil industry to the point that we can\u2019t even produce our own gasoline and its parts are being given away to international partners for favors that only worsen the current situation. But what will that look like in the future? This is the question that has to be in the center of our minds when analyzing the ENCOVI results.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does the world realize the urgency of what\u2019s going on in Venezuela and what it can become? High levels of malnutrition, low levels of education, rising infant deaths, migration of citizens who are approaching their most productive years, aging of the local population, limited access to food and health services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The diagnosis is clear, our country is dying.
