But for some of those migrants, the COVID-19 pandemic meant a forceful return after living on a day-to-day basis, unable to afford rent anymore. Today, they\u2019re waiting for the quarantine to be over to start a life, again, from scratch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A 27-year-old woman from Barquisimeto, Lara State (who asked to remain anonymous), says that she left for C\u00facuta, Colombia, during the first days of January 2020. Her aunt and uncle had already moved there in mid-2019 and they made a living teaching acting. The young woman, who was an Arts major at the Universidad Central Lisandro Alvarado and was only missing her thesis, decided to leave and try her luck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She was able to work as an arts teacher for only two months. Her employers had to send her home because of the pandemic, and she didn\u2019t have savings to pay for her room, so she had no choice but to return to Venezuela. Her aunt and uncle were left without pesos too, even though they had spent more time in Colombia, and were also forced to leave. \u201cIf we ate, we couldn\u2019t pay rent. If we paid a month\u2019s rent, then we couldn\u2019t eat. We returned to Venezuela because at least we have our own place here,\u201d says the young lady\u2019s aunt, who requested to remain anonymous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On April 29<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the three of them entered Venezuelan soil. The government that expelled them through absurd economic policies, received them with mismanagement. The young Larense and her aunt and uncle, had to spend six nights in the San Antonio del T\u00e1chira bus terminal, near the border with Colombia, waiting for a bus from the Maduro administration to take them to Barquisimeto.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On May 6<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, they reached their assigned shelter: the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Villa Bolivariana.<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> All three of them spent 14 days in lockdown, where the young woman says that things \u201cwere unbearable\u201d. She says that they got locked inside an apartment, and the door would open only when food was brought in, \u201cfood that you wouldn\u2019t give to a dog.\u201d She says that the apartment had no running water (rationed for one hour a day) and the place was shared with people. She also says that Cuban doctors would go by every day to check on people and would recommend medicine to those with any disease.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, they\u2019re waiting for the quarantine to be over to start a life, again, from scratch.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After officers from the National Guard allowed them to leave, she was able to see her mother after three months, a moment she says she\u2019ll never forget.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although her love for her family can be a big reason to stay, she says that she can\u2019t. Ever since she came back, she\u2019s been working as a private tutor, because the pandemic also forced schools to close. What each parent pays for their child is barely enough for her to live, and this encourages her to flee again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The girl is now waiting for the COVID-19 pandemic to be over, or for a vaccine to come out. Her first goal is to hand in her thesis and graduate; she\u2019ll then leave, this time for Spain. \u201cIt\u2019s a more stable country and with less xenophobia,\u201d she says.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also Expelled by South America<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00c1ngel, a 27-year-old from T\u00e1chira State, is on the same side of the curb. In 2017, he left for Lima, Peru, with his girlfriend. After working at a cake factory where he was forced to handle hot batter without the proper tools, he decided to return in December 2019.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When he left, \u00c1ngel had to quit his 7<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> semester in Animal Production Engineering at the Universidad Nacional Experimental del T\u00e1chira. When he returned to San Crist\u00f3bal, capital of the state, he told himself that he\u2019d finish it, not counting on a short circuit that would burn down the area where the university holds the entire student body database. The staff couldn\u2019t reinstate him because they didn\u2019t know which subjects he had passed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The area where \u00c1ngel lives has power cuts for six to eight hours each day, and in January and February he experienced (once again) what it\u2019s like to spend two days in line to fill up a tank of gas.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, in March, he decided to leave again, hoping for the pandemic to be over soon so that he can go and get a job in the United States. Latin America, to him, is the same as Venezuela: bad wages, work exploitation and xenophobia, a trade of old problems for new ones. \u201cIn America, you break your back working, but you get paid well. In Peru and those countries, you work hard, and your salary is just enough for food and rent.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Leaving isn\u2019t easy, and neither is coming back to an old reality that you now have to endure indefinitely because of the pandemic<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2236,"featured_media":81031,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":""},"categories":[1007],"tags":[932],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/IMG-8012-scaled.jpg","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.0.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Forced to Return\u2026 Only to Leave Again | Caracas Chronicles<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow\" \/>\n<meta name=\"googlebot\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"bingbot\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/07\/17\/forced-to-return-only-to-leave-again\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Forced to Return\u2026 Only to Leave Again | Caracas Chronicles\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Leaving isn\u2019t easy, and neither is coming back to an old reality that you now have to endure indefinitely because of the pandemic\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/07\/17\/forced-to-return-only-to-leave-again\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Caracas Chronicles\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:publisher\" content=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CaracasChronicles\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2020-07-17T18:58:23+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:modified_time\" content=\"2020-07-17T18:50:52+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/IMG-8012-scaled.jpg\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:width\" content=\"2560\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:height\" content=\"1600\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:creator\" content=\"@CaracasChron\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:site\" content=\"@CaracasChron\" \/>\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/#website\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/\",\"name\":\"Caracas Chronicles\",\"description\":\"Making Venezuela make sense\",\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"SearchAction\",\"target\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/?s={search_term_string}\",\"query-input\":\"required name=search_term_string\"}],\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\"},{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/07\/17\/forced-to-return-only-to-leave-again\/#primaryimage\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/IMG-8012-scaled.jpg\",\"width\":2560,\"height\":1600},{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/07\/17\/forced-to-return-only-to-leave-again\/#webpage\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/07\/17\/forced-to-return-only-to-leave-again\/\",\"name\":\"Forced to Return\\u2026 Only to Leave Again | Caracas Chronicles\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/#website\"},\"primaryImageOfPage\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/07\/17\/forced-to-return-only-to-leave-again\/#primaryimage\"},\"datePublished\":\"2020-07-17T18:58:23+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2020-07-17T18:50:52+00:00\",\"author\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/#\/schema\/person\/29ee172891c198a1130ba1bcda5fa5db\"},\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"ReadAction\",\"target\":[\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/07\/17\/forced-to-return-only-to-leave-again\/\"]}]},{\"@type\":[\"Person\"],\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/#\/schema\/person\/29ee172891c198a1130ba1bcda5fa5db\",\"name\":\"Daisy Galaviz\",\"image\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/#personlogo\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/78aa5c576ccdffc48e3eb9ebdc461386?s=96&d=mm&r=g\",\"caption\":\"Daisy Galaviz\"},\"description\":\"Journalist for El Pitazo and Monitor de V\\u00edctimas (Runrunes).

If you pay $150, you can get on a bus to any part of the country,\u201d a 48-year-old Venezuelan who is stuck at the border told us recently, although he can\u2019t afford to bribe the Venezuelan officials to let him through.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He\u2019s one of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/lta.reuters.com\/articulo\/salud-coronavirus-colombia-migracion-idLTAKBN23N061\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tens of thousands<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Venezuelans returning home amid the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the economic, political, and humanitarian crises in Venezuela. Many returning migrants slip through unofficial border crossings, some having to pay bribes to cross, risking spreading the virus as they return home. Those who enter through official crossings face an ineffective system at the border that may spread the disease instead of halting it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The man we interviewed left his hometown in Anzo\u00e1tegui to pursue a better life in Bogot\u00e1 less than a year ago. But the pandemic crushed his plans, since lockdown measures obliterated the informal sector where he worked and he could no longer afford rent and food. He walked for 30 days to the border and crossed into Venezuela through one of the hundreds of illegal crossings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has claimed that when returnees arrive to Venezuela \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/VTVcanal8\/status\/1271219754011852800\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they\u2019re free, have dignity and are humans again<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d He clearly hasn\u2019t visited the border these days.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A government <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1TahFxAqCYf3h-MTY-mwddWWbOhwFWoUS\/view\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">protocol<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> considers anyone entering the country as a suspected COVID-19 case, and requires testing and then staying in quarantine at the border before continuing the journey.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In theory, the screening and testing protocol could help identify, isolate, and treat returning Venezuelans with COVID-19, but delays and problems with the testing protocol could instead magnify transmission. Local news outlets <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/lanacionweb.com\/frontera\/ocho-dias-a-la-intemperie-retornados-y-migrantes-internos\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have reported<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the people waiting for tests have to fend for themselves. The man we talked to, who was able to get tested and then was transferred to a quarantine shelter after more than a week, said the people waiting for testing slept on the street without distancing or masks, filled their bottles with rainwater and waited to be admitted without official support.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People waiting for testing slept on the street without distancing or masks, filled their bottles with rainwater and waited to be admitted without official support.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some aid workers said there were delays because the tests are in short supply. In other cases, people who cross through the long, porous border between Colombia and Venezuela simply aren\u2019t tested.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Waiting to be tested isn\u2019t the only time returnees may be at risk; returning Venezuelans with a negative antibody rapid test are required to isolate in a shelter. This makes sense because the rapid antibody test used to screen them can be falsely negative during the early and most contagious time of infection.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this also means that some people entering the quarantine shelters may be infected and, without adequate protections, could easily spread COVID-19 to others. Many quarantine shelters, which range from hotels to stadiums to abandoned schools, are overcrowded and people face unsanitary conditions, including difficulty accessing water. This has made social distancing and handwashing, two basic measures to prevent COVID-19 from spreading, nearly impossible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On July 8th, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zjXY-ffzUsc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maduro said<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> people crossing through illegal passageways were \u201ccontaminating their communities\u201d and \u201ckilling their families\u201d.

This stigmatization and intimidation of an already vulnerable population undermines the testing efforts.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plight of Venezuelan returnees illustrates the desperate situation that the Maduro government has created. The returnees originally fled a repressive regime that contributed to a man-made humanitarian emergency at home only to face vulnerability abroad, which has worsened with the pandemic. They\u2019re now returning to inflammatory rhetoric and even more precarious conditions in a country that had a collapsed health system <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hrw.org\/report\/2019\/04\/04\/venezuelas-humanitarian-emergency\/large-scale-un-response-needed-address-health\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">even before the pandemic hit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eltiempo.com\/mundo\/venezuela\/que-pasa-con-los-venezolanos-que-buscan-regresar-a-su-pais-505094\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">continuous flow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of returnees making their way from various parts of the continent, the conditions at the border, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.migracioncolombia.gov.co\/noticias\/nuevas-restricciones-en-corredores-humanitarios-por-parte-de-venezuela\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">restrictions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the Maduro government has imposed on the number of people who can enter the country through official access points, stories like the one we heard are likely to become more common.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To limit the spread of COVID-19 in Venezuela and protect the rights of people returning, Venezuela needs to provide prompt and appropriate testing and proper conditions in quarantine shelters at the border. But given the hostility the Maduro administration has shown toward returnees, the government is unlikely to take the necessary steps without strong international pressure.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their efforts to push for a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hrw.org\/news\/2020\/05\/26\/venezuela-urgent-aid-needed-combat-covid-19\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">large scale and apolitical UN-led humanitarian response in Venezuela<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, United Nations Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and his humanitarian team at its highest levels, as well as donor governments, should pressure Venezuelan authorities to end their stigmatizing rhetoric and accept a border protocol that respects citizens\u2019 rights; with international humanitarian aid that is distributed by an independent third party. Meanwhile, Latin American governments should ensure that Venezuelans in their countries have access to legal status and proper health care there, so they don\u2019t feel forced to return to Venezuela\u2019s desperate reality. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The vulnerability that drove many Venezuelans to leave their home country has increased because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Case of the Venezuelan Gold in England"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took the United Kingdom\u2019s High Court merely a week to push back against a solid attempt by the Venezuelan government to access around one billion dollars in gold stored at the Bank of England (BoE), citing Downing Street\u2019s \u201cunequivocal recognition\u201d of Juan Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s head of state. The decision on July 2nd prompted immediate celebration from most of the Venezuelan opposition and ire from government circles. However, the effects of the decision are not clear.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the actual trial and decision lasting just under two weeks, the dispute over Venezuela\u2019s gold held inside the BoE has been brewing since late last year, when the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV) first sought out to repatriate around 14 tons of bullion.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to reports at the time, BoE officials first began to stall the request for repatriation<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a fairly routine exercise for any custodian<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">citing the difficulty and cost in obtaining insurance for the shipment. Indeed, assuming an underwriter had an even passing knowledge of what goes on in the Maiquet\u00eda airport, this decision is financially sound. But for a custodian such as the BoE, which had already conducted similar dealings with Caracas as early as 2012, insurance hurdles were an improbable excuse, and many industry watchers were quick to point that out.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several weeks later, in early November 2019, London-based news outlets elaborated on the matter, disclosing that British officials needed clarification on what the Venezuelan government intended to do with the bullion, adding that \u201cstandard measures to prevent money-laundering\u201d would need to be addressed. These reports came days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order under which, by all intents and purposes, Venezuelan dealings in the precious metal were censored.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This particular reasoning, assuming that the gold would be used to facilitate money laundering, even if correct<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is flawed too. The BoE has limited rights to enquire on what the end use of the gold would be, and the de facto freezing of a state\u2019s assets violates a number of custodian agreements and international law.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Already discounting procedural and legal arguments, the BoE\u2019s motivation behind its stall tactics were expanded upon in January 2020, when <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2019-01-25\/u-k-said-to-deny-maduro-s-bid-to-pull-1-2-billion-of-gold\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloomberg<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported that top U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and then National Security Advisor John Bolton, had lobbied their UK counterparts to cut Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s regime off its overseas assets. The BoE also received a number of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/static.bullionstar.com\/blogs\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Borges-Vecchio-Letter-to-the-BoE.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">public appeals<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by several opposition heavy weights to maintain the gold inside its vaults<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a plea that was echoed by UK backbench MPs.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The BoE has limited rights to enquire on what the end use of the gold would be, and the de facto freezing of a state\u2019s assets violates a number of custodian agreements and international law.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, once it became clear that neither the BoE nor HM Treasury would budge on the matter, the Venezuelan regime turned to the Commercial Court of the High Court Justice, arguing that the gold would finance coronavirus-related relief with the UN Development Programme (UNDP), which superficially appears to have played along with the excuse.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fast forward to the time of writing and Judge Nigel Teare&#8217;s unwillingness to father the first gold-PPE swap in financial history.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bailii.org\/ew\/cases\/EWHC\/Comm\/2020\/1721.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">decision<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Judge Teare referenced the so-called \u201cone voice\u201d doctrine, arguing that the court must accept as conclusive the political decision by the British government to recognize Guaid\u00f3 as the leader of Venezuela. This is despite the UK maintaining ties with the Venezuelan government by keeping an embassy in Caracas and continuing to have contact with the BCV. These arguments were dismissed by the court, which <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-latin-america-53262767\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stated <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that there was \u201cno room for recognition of Mr. Guaid\u00f3 as de jure president and of Mr. Maduro as de facto president.\u201d The judge, in other words, deferred to the UK government\u2019s political guidance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, first and foremost, the decision is a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/presidenciave.com\/presidencia\/comunicado-oficial-ante-la-decision-de-la-alta-corte-de-londres-que-reconoce-al-gobierno-legitimo-del-presidente-e-juan-guaido\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">win<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the Venezuelan opposition largely due to the regime\u2019s unadulterated history of corruption and mismanagement. Indeed, the notion that 100% of the gold would have gone to aid the government\u2019s coronavirus response is laughable to most Venezuelans. And even if it was transferred directly from London to UN headquarters in New York, one does not simply show up at the UNDP with a bag full of gold and expect PPE in return.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nevertheless, the decision doesn\u2019t immediately transfer the gold to the opposition either. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s camp would eventually need to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/in.reuters.com\/article\/venezuela-gold\/britain-recognises-guaido-as-venezuelas-president-in-gold-dispute-judge-rules-idINKBN2431PQ\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">petition<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the BoE and the court to become the legal representatives of the bullion. And given that the BoE custodian agreement isn\u2019t with the Venezuelan executive, but with the BCV, the bank and the court would now need to extend their recognition to the ad hoc BCV board named by Guaid\u00f3. Incidentally, all five members of the board now have Venezuelan <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.abc.es\/internacional\/abci-venezuela-emite-11-ordenes-detencion-contra-aliados-guaido-despojo-reino-unido-202007041538_noticia.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arrest<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> warrants.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assuming that the Guaid\u00f3-BCV issue is resolved in the near future, there are also domestic Venezuelan laws that would restrict the BCV\u2019s ability to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/es.euronews.com\/2020\/07\/06\/el-disputado-oro-de-venezuela-por-que-el-banco-de-inglaterra-ha-dado-las-reservas-a-guaido\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maneuver<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and deal with the bullion.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opposition can of course consider the ruling a fait accompli and attempt to knock on the door of the BoE tomorrow and ask for the gold to be handed over. However, what would be the likely response by an institution that has already set a precedent for asking too many questions and over-valuing political considerations? Would the BoE have reason to think that the opposition isn\u2019t frugal or financially adept at auditing its members? Would the BoE not consider what self-identified members of the opposition have condoned and supported in the past?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until the UK High Court takes up the matter again and decides on whether Guaid\u00f3\u2019s camp is the bullion\u2019s legal representative, the current limbo will persist.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While further exegesis of the law is required, Guaid\u00f3\u2019s legal team (which has <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dw.com\/es\/guaid%C3%B3-el-oro-ser%C3%A1-protegido-hasta-la-transici%C3%B3n-en-venezuela\/a-54047192\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">signalled<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that they don\u2019t seek to move the gold anytime soon) has indicated its willingness to consider the precedent set by the ruling and seek to at least freeze other foreign assets across Europe. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The caretaker government\u2019s Ambassador to the UK, Vanessa Neumann, has provided little detail on what specific assets they might target next, but the entire exercise <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">might be a little bit trickier than expected.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In recent years, the Venezuelan government has wound down numerous operations and assets across the continent in a bid to avoid U.S. sanctions, and politics in those specific countries might not be able to bend judicial decisions. Ms. Neumann admitted as much in an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.elnuevosiglo.com.co\/articulos\/06-2020-puja-por-oro-venezolano-hacia-un-fallo-politico-de-quilates\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interview<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with El Nuevo Siglo, stating: \u201cA legal ruling has much more weight than a political pronouncement and that should set a precedent for other foreign assets in Europe. That\u2019s what we are thinking. But let&#8217;s see, because between theory and practice (&#8230;) particularly when it comes to politics and money, there are always complications.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Setting \u201ccomplications\u201d aside, if the opposition is able to find and target other assets in friendly countries across Europe, further rulings like that of Judge Teare are likely on the pipeline.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the single silver lining, for now, is how the BoE has a pretty solid record as a custodian. Past custodians for countries which have seen large financial assets frozen have been more than permeable to corruption. Libya\u2019s wealth fund, for example, was frozen by the UN Security Council following the toppling of Muammar Qaddafi in 2011, but has seen leaks develop ever since, with large amounts of cash going missing in transactions that should have never been cleared by investment banks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The BoE, i<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">n contrast, holds bullion on a set-aside basis, so a clear record and weight list of each gold bar is likely available to Ms Neumann, and Guaido-backed BCV officials. The BoE also<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> facilitates gold lending in London using the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), to facilitate deposits and swaps. In this case, the original gold bars are taken by banks offering access to the financial instruments, but the banks and the BoE both have a liability to the customer. Hence, it is safe to assume that there won\u2019t be much leakage, or opportunities for corruption will at least be very limited.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, until the UK High Court takes up the matter again and decides on whether Guaid\u00f3\u2019s camp is the bullion\u2019s legal representative, the current limbo will persist. Another positive ruling for the opposition will, nevertheless, have a significant number of strings attached that might limit Guaid\u00f3\u2019s use of the funds. Avenues to change the likely status quo are beyond the scope of this particular article, but unless the opposition shortens the gap between them and the White House<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which would take considerable effort following the still beyond-words \u201cOperation Gede\u00f3n\u201d, and comes up with a credible excuse to use the funds, that bullion is not going anywhere.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s regime is officially barred from accessing the Venezuelan gold stored at the Bank of England.

In the meantime, the United States is in the process of withdrawing from the World Health Organization.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the case of Venezuela, the Chinese government had shied away from publicly supporting Maduro\u2014at least compared to how effusive it used to be just a few years back. The last visit of a high-level Chinese diplomat to Venezuela was that of President Xi Jinping in 2014, no new loans have been extended since 2016, and news about the Venezuelan crisis has been largely ignored by Chinese official media. China\u2019s reticence towards Venezuela can be explained by the fact that after USD$65 billion in loans\u2014given the appalling results of their projects in the country\u2014they don\u2019t want to be blamed for the Venezuelan debacle.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After all, developing nations far outnumber developed ones, and Venezuela\u2019s vote at the United Nations counts the same as Germany\u2019s.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But all that might change in the coming months: many political analysts tend to portray Beijing\u2019s media push within the framework of the growing tensions between China and the West, particularly with the United States. They\u2019re missing the point. China\u2019s donations and outreach efforts are directed at the developing world in the hopes of gaining wider support for its policies internationally. After all, developing nations far outnumber developed ones, and Venezuela\u2019s vote at the United Nations counts the same as Germany\u2019s. The more \u201cfriends\u201d China has globally, the more clout it will have in international forums. The diplomatic bickering between China and the West is just part of the sideshow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the context of COVID-19, Venezuela earned a new place in China\u2019s geopolitical considerations. The detention camps for Uighurs in Xinjiang, the National Security Law in Hong Kong, cross-strait relations with Taiwan, and the government\u2019s handling of COVID-19, are all considered national security concerns by the CCP. Given the growing tensions with the West and the intense criticism received because of the aforementioned items, China will seek to strengthen the voices of those countries that support its policies. And that\u2019s where Maduro comes in. Having a vocal supporter in the Americas that defends Chinese policies might carry enough weight for Beijing to extend a new lifeline to Maduro.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A clear manifestation of this was the last session of the United Nations Human Rights Council celebrated in Geneva on June, 30<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. During the meeting, two statements were read back to back, one promoted by Cuba in support of China&#8217;s passing of the National Security Law for Hong Kong, and the other by the U.K. condemning it. 52 countries sided with Cuba, 26 with the UK, and many abstained from voting. Not one country from Latin America or Africa opposed the statement. Maduro\u2019s representative obviously voted in favor, while the United States <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">brill\u00f3 por su ausencia<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since it withdrew from the body in 2018.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Excluding the nations that hold official relations with Taiwan, every country in Latin America has received some form of medical support from China. Although there\u2019s no comprehensive data on China\u2019s donations to the region, there\u2019s no doubt China\u2019s aid dwarfs that of any other country or international organization. Back in March, the Jack Ma Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the Alibaba group, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.alizila.com\/factsheet-jack-ma-foundation-alibaba-foundations-coronavirus-donations-and-efforts\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pledged to donate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a total of two million masks, 400,000 test kits and 104 ventilators to 24 Latin American countries. Chinese companies Huawei, ZTE, Didi, China Railway Construction Corporation, among others, have all made sizable donations throughout the region. Venezuela was the first country to receive Chinese medical personnel back in March.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s still a long way ahead in the fight against COVID-19, and the jury is still out on whether China\u2019s donations and media push will bear fruit. One thing is clear though, while the United States is marred by its domestic politics during an election year, and most of the Western world is focused on its own handling of the pandemic, China is the only big player reaching out to developing countries. In the post-COVID-19 world, the international order might look quite different, and liberal democracies will not be too happy about it.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Asian superpower has been building a tight relationship with Venezuela and all of Latin America for years.

He had always planned to do his medical residency program abroad and then go back to his native Bol\u00edvar, in southern Venezuela. By the time he graduated, he still wanted to go abroad for his residency, but coming back wasn\u2019t part of the plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Something that cemented his decision to leave took place shortly after graduation. Medical doctors in Venezuela are required to do a rural year, and in Bol\u00edvar, they get to choose according to how well they did in medical school. Jos\u00e9 graduated first of his class, meaning he should\u2019ve had first pick regarding where he was going to do his rural. However, graduates with acquaintances in the government office chose before Jos\u00e9. He realized that having the right connections would always overrule performance in chavismo\u2019s Venezuela.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After considering Italy and Spain, due to his family roots, Jos\u00e9 started to research Germany as an option. There, he would have no trouble finding a job after his residency. The biggest obstacle would be the language, but always eager to learn new things, Jos\u00e9 started to study German during his rural year. He left for Germany in April, 2017.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After he arrived in the city of Wesel, he took an assessment test, where he was placed at the B1 level. He started an intensive course an hour away, in D\u00fcsseldorf, in which he felt terribly challenged as he had to interpret texts in German at a level he wasn\u2019t used to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As he did all the paperwork necessary to get a work permit as a doctor, he was able to find a job at the Red Cross. However, Jos\u00e9 had to take a medical language test for which he studied alone. He did great, and he now had a permit that allowed him to stay in Germany. He could only work for two years, and only in North-Rhine Westphalia.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_80998\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"max-width: 982px;\" itemprop=\"image\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/ImageObject\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/TADY-Jose.jpeg\" data-fancybox=\"image\"><img data-attachment-id=\"80998\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/07\/12\/tales-of-a-displaced-youth-jose\/tady-jose\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/TADY-Jose.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"972,1296\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Tales of a Displaced Youth: Jos\u00e9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/TADY-Jose-225x300.jpeg\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/TADY-Jose-768x1024.jpeg\" class=\"wp-image-80998 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/TADY-Jose.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"972\" height=\"1296\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/TADY-Jose.jpeg 972w, https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/TADY-Jose-225x300.jpeg 225w, https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/TADY-Jose-768x1024.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 972px) 100vw, 972px\" \/><\/a><figcaption itemprop=\"caption\"><h6>&#8220;As he did all the paperwork necessary to get a work permit as a doctor, he was able to find a job at the Red Cross.

As the days went on, his stress increased, until suddenly, all the places started to respond. Jos\u00e9 went to four interviews, and the four hospitals offered him the job. He started to work as a medical doctor in June 2018.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this time, Jos\u00e9 got to see how difficult it was to make friends in Germany. While he always was treated with respect, German culture is a lot more reserved. His colleagues wouldn\u2019t consider him a friend for a long time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He waited until he felt more comfortable with the medical language and the German medical system to apply for the permanent validation of his degree. He would have to take a comprehensive exam, in which he would be interrogated by a panel of three doctors for an entire day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2019, Jos\u00e9 was notified about the date of his test only a month before he had to take it and the place appointed would be M\u00fcnster, infamous for having the toughest evaluators, with a very low approval rate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jos\u00e9 had to review six years of med school in German, and would later remember this as one of the hardest months since he left Venezuela.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The day of the test came and Jos\u00e9, along with four other doctors, were interrogated for over ten hours. Jos\u00e9\u2019s preparation and his German skills didn\u2019t go unnoticed and he was one of the two who passed. Now, he plans to keep studying Internal Medicine. In the future, he\u2019d like to set up a consult where people from different nationalities feel welcomed, and where he can make use of both his medical knowledge and his language skills. Germany is a very different place from what he had seen in Venezuela. Slowly but surely, he has earned the trust of his colleagues, and he has developed true friendships. He doesn\u2019t know what the future will bring, but he knows that he is in the right place for him, and for whatever may come.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Leaving your country of origin to look for a new job is quite the task, especially for those who have to learn a new language.
