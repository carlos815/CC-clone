Making use of foreign language official media and the social media accounts of Chinese officials and government entities, Beijing has launched a worldwide campaign to promote its narrative regarding China\u2019s handling of the pandemic. The message has three core components: the Chinese government managed the first outbreak transparently and efficiently, China is leading the effort to help developing nations in dealing with the pandemic, and Western nations have done poorly in containing the spread of the virus. Buttressing the message is an unequivocal comparison between a China success story and a Western failure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">China\u2019s message is unmistakably targeted at the Global South. In his address at the World Health Assembly on May 18<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.globaltimes.cn\/content\/1188716.shtml\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">President Xi Jinping said<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> China will provide US$2 billion to developing countries to help them address the economic and social consequences of the pandemic. In the meantime, the United States is in the process of withdrawing from the World Health Organization.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the case of Venezuela, the Chinese government had shied away from publicly supporting Maduro\u2014at least compared to how effusive it used to be just a few years back. The last visit of a high-level Chinese diplomat to Venezuela was that of President Xi Jinping in 2014, no new loans have been extended since 2016, and news about the Venezuelan crisis has been largely ignored by Chinese official media. China\u2019s reticence towards Venezuela can be explained by the fact that after USD$65 billion in loans\u2014given the appalling results of their projects in the country\u2014they don\u2019t want to be blamed for the Venezuelan debacle.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After all, developing nations far outnumber developed ones, and Venezuela\u2019s vote at the United Nations counts the same as Germany\u2019s.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But all that might change in the coming months: many political analysts tend to portray Beijing\u2019s media push within the framework of the growing tensions between China and the West, particularly with the United States. They\u2019re missing the point. China\u2019s donations and outreach efforts are directed at the developing world in the hopes of gaining wider support for its policies internationally. After all, developing nations far outnumber developed ones, and Venezuela\u2019s vote at the United Nations counts the same as Germany\u2019s. The more \u201cfriends\u201d China has globally, the more clout it will have in international forums. The diplomatic bickering between China and the West is just part of the sideshow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the context of COVID-19, Venezuela earned a new place in China\u2019s geopolitical considerations. The detention camps for Uighurs in Xinjiang, the National Security Law in Hong Kong, cross-strait relations with Taiwan, and the government\u2019s handling of COVID-19, are all considered national security concerns by the CCP. Given the growing tensions with the West and the intense criticism received because of the aforementioned items, China will seek to strengthen the voices of those countries that support its policies. And that\u2019s where Maduro comes in. Having a vocal supporter in the Americas that defends Chinese policies might carry enough weight for Beijing to extend a new lifeline to Maduro.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A clear manifestation of this was the last session of the United Nations Human Rights Council celebrated in Geneva on June, 30<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. During the meeting, two statements were read back to back, one promoted by Cuba in support of China&#8217;s passing of the National Security Law for Hong Kong, and the other by the U.K. condemning it. 52 countries sided with Cuba, 26 with the UK, and many abstained from voting. Not one country from Latin America or Africa opposed the statement. Maduro\u2019s representative obviously voted in favor, while the United States <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">brill\u00f3 por su ausencia<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since it withdrew from the body in 2018.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Excluding the nations that hold official relations with Taiwan, every country in Latin America has received some form of medical support from China. Although there\u2019s no comprehensive data on China\u2019s donations to the region, there\u2019s no doubt China\u2019s aid dwarfs that of any other country or international organization. Back in March, the Jack Ma Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the Alibaba group, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.alizila.com\/factsheet-jack-ma-foundation-alibaba-foundations-coronavirus-donations-and-efforts\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pledged to donate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a total of two million masks, 400,000 test kits and 104 ventilators to 24 Latin American countries. Chinese companies Huawei, ZTE, Didi, China Railway Construction Corporation, among others, have all made sizable donations throughout the region. Venezuela was the first country to receive Chinese medical personnel back in March.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s still a long way ahead in the fight against COVID-19, and the jury is still out on whether China\u2019s donations and media push will bear fruit. One thing is clear though, while the United States is marred by its domestic politics during an election year, and most of the Western world is focused on its own handling of the pandemic, China is the only big player reaching out to developing countries. In the post-COVID-19 world, the international order might look quite different, and liberal democracies will not be too happy about it.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Asian superpower has been building a tight relationship with Venezuela and all of Latin America for years.

Be it the economy, conflict abroad, or migration policies, candidates tend to emphasize one issue\u2014tested for hundreds of hours on focus groups\u2014and then they repeat it again, and again, and then some more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This election season, we\u2019re likely going to hear a lot about Venezuela. The reason: Latino voters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Electoral arguments are rarely built without having a specific demographic in mind, the larger the better. This year, Latinos are expected for the first time to be the largest ethnic minority in the U.S., with around 32 million Latinos expected to be eligible to vote. That number is compounded by the fact that two-in-three Latino voters <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2020\/03\/03\/most-of-the-23-million-immigrants-eligible-to-vote-in-2020-election-live-in-just-five-states\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">live<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in just five states: California, New York, Texas, Arizona, and Florida. The latter three will be in contention in November 2020.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eligible Latino voters have for the most part sided with the Democratic Party in recent years, but they\u2019re hardly a predictable voting bloc. The 2016 elections served to debunk several widely held beliefs echoed by most American pollsters, the majority of which suggested that Trump\u2019s hawkish immigration rhetoric would eventually push even conservative-leaning Hispanics to vote against the Republican candidate. Left-leaning Hispanics, moreover, would be mobilized to vote in droves in support of the Democratic front-runner, regardless of their policy priorities. This didn\u2019t happen.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A surge in Latino voters didn\u2019t <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2016\/12\/22\/506347254\/latinos-will-never-vote-for-a-republican-and-other-myths-about-hispanics-from-20\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">materialize<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and the overall numbers of Hispanics who voted for the Democratic Party fell by 5% from 2012 to 2016. How many Hispanics voted for Trump is a debated issue, estimates ranging from 28% to 18%, but that\u2019s still a sizable number considering that Trump doesn\u2019t need to win the entire <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/magazine\/story\/2019\/02\/24\/2020-hispanic-voters-donald-trump-225192\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vote <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to come out with a successful outcome in most states; he just needs to move the needle.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team around Trump does understand the damage the U.S. president will do to his re-election chances if he appears weak on Venezuela, and loses voters in South Florida.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Setting aside the myriad of explanations why Latinos didn\u2019t immediately rush to the Democratic camp\u2014ranging from economic arguments (increased economic competition) to syncretic values (abortion)\u2014there\u2019s little evidence to suggest we might not see a repeat of 2016, and that Republicans can\u2019t <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/hispanic\/fact-sheet\/latinos-in-the-2016-election-florida\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">attract <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a sizeable number of Hispanic voters. And one specific sub-section of the voting bloc is likely to be in the sights of Republican pollsters: first and second-generation Cubans residing in South Florida.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two-thirds of the U.S.\u2019 1.2 million eligible Cuban voters live in Florida, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2016\/11\/15\/unlike-other-latinos-about-half-of-cuban-voters-in-florida-backed-trump\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">representing <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">around 31% of all Latino voters. This particular voting bloc is also heavily skewed to the right, and still holds a grudge towards an Obama administration that sought to normalize relations with the communist government in Havana and failed to pressure Caracas during its transition between Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Indeed, around 54% of Cubans voted for Trump the first time around, according to the Pew Research Center.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among first and second-generation Cuban migrants in Florida, there are several widely held beliefs, including the notion that the communist regime in Havana continues to exist in large part because of Caracas, and the support Venezuela has granted not only to the Castros but to every left-leaning government across the continent. Indeed, at its height, trade with Venezuela <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2014\/may\/27\/cuba-venezuela-castro-maduro-socialist-economics-reform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">accounted<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for around 20% of Cuba\u2019s GDP, and Venezuela\u2019s economic downfall has also catalyzed the return of bread lines across Cuba.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump\u2019s re-election campaign doesn\u2019t need to elaborate on this argument or list them out in a comprehensive manner. Come November, it just needs to continue to deliver the message it has delivered for much of the past three years: \u201cWe are tough on Venezuela.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What \u2018Tough on Venezuela\u2019 Really Means<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This message, one would think, is pretty easy to deliver and there is tangible evidence to suggest that Trump is in fact, in favor of Venezuelan democracy. Ironically\u2014or what others inside the beltway would describe as predictably\u2014Trump doesn\u2019t help himself when speaking out of turn. In late June, we saw the U.S. president saying loud and clear to an Axios reporter that he would be open to meeting with Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, adding in passing that not only does he \u201close very little with [these types of] meetings\u201d, but that Maduro\u2019s principal opposition, Juan Guaid\u00f3, might not be up to the job.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The White House later did damage control, listing out Trump\u2019s record on Venezuela and embellishing some of his rhetoric. The fast-paced response from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is, again, evidence to suggest that the team around Trump does understand the damage the U.S. president will do to his re-election chances if he appears weak on Venezuela, and loses voters in South Florida.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The message \u201cTough on Venezuela\u201d also plays well in other corners of the Republican party. Namely, foreign policy hawks that see an encroaching Russia and China on what they likely refer to as America\u2019s \u201cbackyard\u201d. The issue of China, in particular, is no longer a bipartisan issue in Washington, and both Republicans and Democrats are increasingly weary of Beijing\u2019s influence in Caracas\u2014even though most Democrats might seem reticent to admit that fact.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, Trump\u2019s stance in support of a democratic transition of power in Venezuela, and removing it from Beijing\u2019s sphere of influence is one of the few issues where the Democratic camp cannot fault Trump\u2019s policy, or come up with a credible rebuttal. These types of policy stances with no easy comeback tend to come up, especially during presidential debates.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fact is, however, that Trump has shown more restraint\u00a0 in the past three years than former presidents in committing U.S. soldiers to open-ended wars.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the campaign heats up, assuming that the ongoing pandemic allows the public and the press to scrutinize candidates, how far will Trump go with \u201cTough on Venezuela\u201d? According to several former staffers and some sitting Latin American presidents, Trump has repeatedly signaled his willingness for a \u201cmilitary solution\u201d. The fact is, however, that Trump has shown more restraint\u00a0 in the past three years than former presidents in committing U.S. soldiers to open-ended wars. More importantly, Trump\u2019s core WASP base is likely malleable enough to follow his rhetoric and even repeat it, but might find it a little more difficult to internalize the arguments to support a war in a foreign country.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Danger of False Hope<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, like much of what happens in Washington, the election\u2019s rhetoric or its messaging will not remain inside U.S. borders. Washington politics is, at best, entertainment for much of the Western world. At worst, a form of delusion which forces people to imagine a vested interest in candidates that are running for a foreign office, in a foreign country, in a foreign continent\u2014and there lies one great danger.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hope isn\u2019t a strategy, and much less when it\u2019s being delivered by a person who\u2019s morally incompetent. \u201cTough on Venezuela\u201d will likely play well in Florida where Cuban voters next to Venezuelan, Colombian, and Argentine minorities will find in it a reassuring policy stance. But for those in Venezuela, the same message will carry other meanings that might instill a false hope of foreign intervention that\u2019s dangerous.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s that false hope that someone else will come and remedy our faults which has led in part to Venezuela\u2019s current social and political crisis. And by November\u2019s end, many Venezuelans are likely to be convinced that \u201csomeone\u201d is coming, purely because of bloated electoral rhetoric delivered by a candidate who has a vested interest in himself, not in 28 million people living across the Caribbean.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Behind the public stance of the American president regarding our

the Giant Sleeps, Maduro Goes All In"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chavismo has a long tradition of setting up parallel structures for whatever they can\u2019t control. It started off, perhaps, when Antonio Ledezma won the elections for Metropolitan Mayor of Caracas in 2009 and Ch\u00e1vez appointed Jackeline Far\u00eda as a sort of parallel mayor and transferred most of the budget and several key functions to her. This pattern continued with the appointment of \u201cprotectors\u201d to run parallel governments in the states where chavismo lost local elections. Similar to what they did by the end of 2015 with the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/06\/08\/when-did-venezuelan-democracy-die\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TSJ<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, now chavismo is repacking the boards of opposition parties with opposition dissidents that can work with them towards a legislative election.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Friday morning, the Venezuela-watching community was deep into the discussion of whether it was possible to dive into elections if the Maduro regime opened a window and allowed the AN\u2019s elections commission to appoint the new directors of the electoral council (CNE). On Wednesday, the chavista Supreme Tribunal of Justice (TSJ) had given an ultimatum to the commission, giving them 72 hours to come up with the names of the new board. This ultimatum was seen by many as a sort of an olive branch. One chance to allow the opposition-controlled AN to participate in the process of naming a new CNE. But an ultimatum is an ultimatum and the bullet was in the chamber. The TSJ had taken all the steps they usually take before naming a new CNE, which they have done twice already. So after the AN said they were going to name the directors in due course without complying with the 72-hour deadline given by the TSJ, the Maduro court went ahead and named them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This fake olive branch, along with the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/06\/09\/the-humanitarian-agreement-between-maduros-regime-and-the-national-assembly-explained\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">health agreement<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> signed between Maduro\u2019s Health Ministry and National Assembly advisors, gave some folks a glimmer of hope that this could actually be the beginning of a civilized exchange between the government and the opposition. Economist Michael Penfold wrote an interesting and heartfelt Twitter thread explaining how a lawfully appointed CNE was a first step towards that. But it was short-lived. In the end, the CNE named three hardcore loyalists, one fake opposition representative and a murky adeco. Exactly what their plan had been from the beginning, as we mentioned that Friday afternoon in our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/caracasconsulting.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Political Risk Report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe 72-hour deadline is considered the TSJ\u2019s last offer for the AN\u2014which expires on June 13th\u2014before appointing (for the CNE board) the five people we reported in last week\u2019s PRR: three PSUV-leaning rectors, TSJ Justice Indira Alfonzo, current rector Tania D\u2019Amelio, and TSJ Justice Gladys Guti\u00e9rrez; and two opposition-leaning rectors, Luis Emilio Rond\u00f3n (Bernab\u00e9 Guti\u00e9rrez\u2019s brother was named in his place) and Rafael Sim\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which makes clear that they never meant to abide by what the commission decided. The decision had been made. Also, according to a PSUV source, Diosdado Cabello was pushing hard for the immediate appointment of the CNE board regardless of the timeframe, since he believes the correlation of international support will shift in their favor once the election is held.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They never meant to abide by what the commission decided. The decision had been made.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a small step forward and twenty steps back for the opposition as this creates more division between the G4 parties.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then\u2026\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the opposition is trying to recover from the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/06\/16\/now-theyre-stealing-ad\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AD blow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the TSJ lands another jab. The Maduro court intervened the Primero Justicia board and handed control to Jos\u00e9 Brito\u2014one of the rogue AN deputies that tried to install a parallel parliament board. And regarding Voluntad Popular, Leopoldo L\u00f3pez\u2019s party, it appears the jury is\u2014literally\u2014still out, as the TSJ is figuring out which chamber should give them the death blow.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to now, at least eight parties have been intervened by the TSJ.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, you could argue that the TSJ is violating the Constitution on top of the fact that it has no legitimacy, that this doesn\u2019t annul the parties, and that they could go about their business by gathering their supporters as if nothing happened. But you could make the same argument against Maduro\u2019s presidency, and in favor of Guaid\u00f3\u2019s administration. But it begs the question: who controls the territory?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And there\u2019s one more thing. What if there are disgruntled militants in these parties? And we\u2019re not talking about the leadership, we\u2019re talking about mid-ranking grunts. People tired of the monolithic structures of the Venezuelan political parties, and who don\u2019t see effective solutions and movement within its ranks. What if they are able to amass enough people to actually rally parallel parties (not just parallel boards) and hold an election including PSUV and all of the big political parties. Would this be enough to make an argument before the international community that a parliament elected using this illegal CNE is legitimate? Well, maybe not before the U.S. But, before this new bullish China? Before Russia? Latin America? Europe?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What has become clear is that, at the moment, there seems to be no middle-ground solution. The idea of a de-escalation of the political conflict, and using the internationally recognized power of the opposition to mediate sanction lifting and the recognition of the government, simply faded away. Chavismo doubles down on its divide and conquer strategy, and seems invested in demonstrating that whatever power the opposition had in government institutions was only because they allowed it. And the opposition was left in The Bad Place, with little possibility to rally a constituency that forgot that politicians are supposed to do politics.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winning in the Three Arenas, So Far<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The regime is organizing its force and coercion resources in three different magnitudes, according to the risk levels in three different areas: the risk of public unrest among the common population, the risk of political competition from the opposition, and the risk of external pressure from the opposition\u2019s allies abroad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The risk of public unrest is manageable, to a certain extent, if the regime preserves its ability to keep the protest under control with the force it can apply with its armed actors, and manages the variables that make people protest, especially utilities and food. Here\u2019s where things get more difficult (more for common Venezuelans, than for the regime), because the lack of water, cooking gas, power, and gasoline will remain. However, by easing the confinement measures\u2014even when COVID-19 cases are spiking right now\u2014the regime is giving space to the population to keep finding their sustenance and therefore reducing the risk of public unrest, because in a country with such economic conditions, confinement is more dangerous for most people\u2019s capacity to survive than coronavirus. Opening the cities and roads also allows reinforcing the propaganda narrative of the Iranian gasoline coming to restart the country, breaking the siege of the United States. So, people will keep protesting for lack of water, power, and cooking gas, but that is not the same as a general uprising. This kind of protest is more pragmatic (let\u2019s block this road and force the local government to provide us with water at least for a day) and it doesn\u2019t represent a political risk; however, it\u2019s a strain on the diminished capacities of the security forces. More protests to attend, mean more gasoline for police trucks, and gasoline is now the most valued resource in the wide list of scarce goods in Venezuela.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chavismo doubles down on its divide and conquer strategy, and seems invested in demonstrating that whatever power the opposition had in government institutions was only because they allowed it.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even more easy is the arena of political competition, the one where chavismo operates to reduce the possibilities of being displaced by a domestic political actor. Here, the regime is closing a phase of erasing the domestic threats created in January 2019 when Juan Guaid\u00f3 took his oath as caretaker president. The cohesion and drive to protest the opposition reacquired at that moment, and especially its chances of producing a break within the Armed Forces, are all but deflated now. The leadership is gone, with little support in the polls, and unable to mobilize protests. The April 30th failure and the Macuto incident showed the opposition has no influence in the military. The centrifuge forces inherent to the opposition alliance are working again to dissolve the existing links under the pressure of reality: the opposition failed and democracy is dead. The next parliamentary elections are just another wedge to divide what\u2019s left of the opposition and has a very high potential of displacing Guaid\u00f3 from the Speakership, and giving the AN back to PSUV. This means not only taking Guaid\u00f3 out of the picture, but also accessing parliament approval for loans and contracts with foreign oil companies, for instance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This leads us to the third arena: the pressure from abroad. The chavista regime has been testing it and has found that Guaid\u00f3\u2019s allies don\u2019t usually walk the talk. Maduro can go forward in his effort to close all the gaps in the hull of his ship and keep sailing at ease, as long as he finds the answer\u2014mostly by acting and seeing\u2014to some strategic questions: What will the \u201cinternational community\u201d do about a new chavista-controlled AN, or about Guaid\u00f3 being apprehended? How much attention will stranded Venezuela get in the context of the pandemic and the economic need to recover? What will Joe Biden do about Venezuela if he is elected president in November?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the regime can control the population in a scenario of an ongoing economic disaster and the spread of COVID-19, as it seems it will, and if it can also continue shattering the opposition in unconnected tribes with several degrees of aggressiveness against the regime but minimal agency to do anything, Maduro can transit unworried for several months.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only one real problem remains: the seas, which are unsafe for Venezuelan oil, for drugs exported by people very close to Maduro, and for businessmen like Walter Ruperti or Alex Saab. Ruperti, a very well known ship owner, has been close to the revolution since the foregone days of the oil strike of 2002, when he offered some vessels to export the oil when the PDV Marina ships remain anchored by their rebel captains. In the recent weeks, he is said to take part again in another rescue, by sending vessels to help the sanctioned PDVSA, exposing them to the OFAC reprisals. And Alex Saab, the main partner of the conglomerate of shadowy companies behind <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2019\/08\/03\/how-armando-info-unveiled-the-claps-web-of-corruption\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CLAP<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and probably the most important business man in the whole world for Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, was taken prisoner this same weekend in Cabo Verde when he stopped to refuel his private plane, between Tehran and Caracas. Now, this human treasure of information and connections remains in custody, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/06\/15\/alex-saab-will-be-extradited-to-the-u-s\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">requested by the U.S<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So we saw the appointment of a new CNE, the detention in the middle of the Atlantic of Maduro\u2019s invaluable friend, and an aggressive take over of the opposition parties between Friday and Tuesday. Many things can happen in Venezuela in four days&#8230; but within some parameters of feasibility. We can expect more incidents related to the sanctions and the warrants on regime-related people. We can expect demonstrations in the streets and anger in the social media, and brute force against them. But at this moment, it\u2019s very unlikely we\u2019ll see something as extraordinary as what happened in January 2019. Maduro won in the short play. He managed to survive the alliance between the AN Speaker, the four main opposition parties, and more than 50 states that recognized Guaid\u00f3 as legitimate president.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, Maduro is being prepared for the long game.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Using the TSJ to take over main opposition parties right after appointing the new CNE board of authorities, the regime wiped out the chances of de-escalation and doesn\u2019t expect there will be a price to pay<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2254,"featured_media":80860,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":""},"categories":[1005],"tags":[804,257],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/IMG_4902-scaled.jpg","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.0.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>While the Giant Sleeps, Maduro Goes All In | Caracas Chronicles<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow\" \/>\n<meta name=\"googlebot\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"bingbot\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/06\/16\/while-the-giant-sleeps-maduro-goes-all-in\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"While the Giant Sleeps, Maduro Goes All In | Caracas Chronicles\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Using the TSJ to take over main opposition parties right after appointing the new CNE board of authorities, the regime wiped out the chances of de-escalation and doesn\u2019t expect there will be a price to pay\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/06\/16\/while-the-giant-sleeps-maduro-goes-all-in\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Caracas Chronicles\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:publisher\" content=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CaracasChronicles\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2020-06-16T23:30:37+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/IMG_4902-scaled.jpg\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:width\" content=\"2560\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:height\" content=\"1195\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:creator\" content=\"@CaracasChron\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:site\" content=\"@CaracasChron\" \/>\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/#website\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/\",\"name\":\"Caracas Chronicles\",\"description\":\"Making Venezuela make sense\",\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"SearchAction\",\"target\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/?s={search_term_string}\",\"query-input\":\"required name=search_term_string\"}],\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\"},{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/06\/16\/while-the-giant-sleeps-maduro-goes-all-in\/#primaryimage\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/IMG_4902-scaled.jpg\",\"width\":2560,\"height\":1195},{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/06\/16\/while-the-giant-sleeps-maduro-goes-all-in\/#webpage\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/06\/16\/while-the-giant-sleeps-maduro-goes-all-in\/\",\"name\":\"While the Giant Sleeps, Maduro Goes All In | Caracas Chronicles\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/#website\"},\"primaryImageOfPage\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/06\/16\/while-the-giant-sleeps-maduro-goes-all-in\/#primaryimage\"},\"datePublished\":\"2020-06-16T23:30:37+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2020-06-16T23:30:37+00:00\",\"author\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/#\/schema\/person\/a3e49ff11f51d0f394a52b39510006c3\"},\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"ReadAction\",\"target\":[\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/06\/16\/while-the-giant-sleeps-maduro-goes-all-in\/\"]}]},{\"@type\":[\"Person\"],\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/#\/schema\/person\/a3e49ff11f51d0f394a52b39510006c3\",\"name\":\"Rafael Os\\u00edo Cabrices &amp;

But two months later, the state\u2019s propaganda machine took a jab to the face with the departure of DirecTV, on May 19<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The state propaganda depended on DirecTV, that\u2019s why there were only shy attempts to restore the CANTV project.

This package included all the networks and community channels, plus 13 radio stations, all controlled by the Maduro regime.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe just weren\u2019t paying attention,\u201d one TV executive told Caracas Chronicles. \u201cWe got confident because of how robust the DirecTV platform was. We halted investments, stopped expansion, and now we have to deal with the consequences.\u201d Only a third of the transmitters appropriated by TVes in the RCTV raid are working. Globovisi\u00f3n never expanded its coverage beyond Caracas and Maracaibo, and the antennas of TV station Televen have been robbed so many times that they stopped trying to replace some of them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Revolution Needs to Be Televised<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Maduro regime\u2019s\u00a0 first response to DirecTV\u2019s departure was \u201cchildish\u201d, according to industry executives. \u201cThey knew they couldn\u2019t get the signal up again. This wasn\u2019t a radio station. But the call for calm was to buy them time,\u201d said a former DirecTV consultant. And he\u2019s right.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maduro\u2019s regime needs television, at least to be there even if people aren&#8217;t watching. It became evident with the arrival of the Iranian oil tankers in late May: the \u201ccelebration\u201d on the state\u2019s TV station, Venezolana de Televisi\u00f3n (VTV), lasted only 20 minutes. They knew that, even in a quarantine, people wouldn\u2019t tune in.

While Venezuelans were tweeting #DirecTVLibre, Maduro\u2019s regime was laying the foundation for a new TV provider with all the Venezuelan channels, plus China\u2019s CCTV and Russia\u2019s RT.\u00a0 One exception in the package, though: Globovisi\u00f3n is missing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThey\u2019re going to have a hard time trying to use DirecTV\u2019s SAT (the control center in Caracas, seized after the Supreme Tribunal\u2019s order of \u201creestablishing the TV service\u201d). And if they do, they won\u2019t be able to use it at full capacity,\u201d explained the former consultant. Building a new infrastructure can take time, and solving how to use part of the seized equipment can be a shortcut to a new network. In the meantime, the regime\u2019s legal efforts are blocking every backdoor possible: on Monday, June 8<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the TSJ banned importing DirecTV decoders, except if permitted by the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ad hoc <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">board named by the regime (instead of the company\u2019s board) presided by none other than the director of Conatel and Ministry of the Office of the Presidency (and 2017 OFAC sanctioned), Jorge Elieser M\u00e1rquez.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resurrecting TDA<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One missing piece of the puzzle is the Digital Terrestrial Television project, spearheaded by the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 2009 under the name <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Televisi\u00f3n Digital Abierta <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(TDA). A corruption scandal involving the purchase of decoders limited its reach, and only 400,000 of the approximately 700,000 devices purchased or assigned by the government are still active. But the pieces are still there: the control centers, the multiplex transmitters, the antennas. And newer TV models have a Digital TV tuner integrated.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s also another potential ray of light for the regime: On May 30<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Sibci uploaded to the Argentinian satellite Arsat2 a third package, including three cellular TDA channels (VTV, TVes, and teleSUR). The same day, Science and Technology Minister Gabriela Jim\u00e9nez <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/gabrielasjr\/status\/1266907213383286789?s=21\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tweeted<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about the TDA project and the TDA channels available in T\u00e1chira, Bol\u00edvar, and Zulia, states that are among the most affected after DirecTV\u2019s departure. Blackouts have rendered many transmitters useless, and only the Galaxy satellite (of DirecTV\u2019s exclusive use) used to reach remote settlements in the south of the country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the signs suggest that, before the end of the year, the Maduro regime will have a portion of his TV propaganda apparatus up and running. And this time, there won\u2019t be much else to choose from, especially if they can replace DirecTV in those areas where there\u2019s no fiber optics to set up regular

<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2020\/may\/27\/venezuela-us-funded-rock-bands-hugo-chavez\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">finding<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as part of his request for information involving the role of U.S. aid agencies in Venezuela during the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comandante Eterno<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> years: In 2011, the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) supported an initiative involving Venezuelan rock bands making songs about free speech.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gill, who sympathizes with chavismo but also recognized the unpopularity and negative effects of Maduro&#8217;s government, has written for years about U.S. assistance for the Venezuelan opposition. Yet, he didn&#8217;t expect this nugget in the documentation he was given, as he wrote in an email he sent me:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI don&#8217;t honestly know if this sort of funding is commonplace. My sense is that it&#8217;s not what comprises the lion&#8217;s share of NED funding in Venezuela or elsewhere. There are stories about the U.S. promoting particular artists through the CIA during the Cold War. This is not something that I&#8217;m an expert in, though. When I saw this particular document, it struck me as peculiar, because I had not seen any overt promotion of bands and festivals by U.S. agencies in Venezuela.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weeks before this report was released, there was a lot of attention over a podcast&#8217;s allegation that the 1990 hit song \u201cWinds of Change,\u201d from the German rock band Scorpions, was actually a product of the CIA. Frontman Klaus Meine (who&#8217;s also the composer of the song) strongly denied it in an interview. So, in the wake of that, it&#8217;s understandable why Gill&#8217;s revelation caused some curiosity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a rough translation of the documents, this seems to be less of an order to \u201cmanufacture\u201d songs and more of a plan to establish a contest along with other civic organizations. A panel of judges would decide the winning songs, to be presented in a live concert, and later released in CD.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since Ch\u00e1vez&#8217;s arrival to power, there have been more than 500 protest songs against the government, with 75% of them coming after 2014<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hegemony responded with a statement of the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coraz\u00f3n Rockero<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> movement, led by veteran local rocker\/hardcore chavista Paul Gillman, openly denouncing the \u201cattempt to corrupt musicians that should write what their free will dictates, instead of what money tells them to.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coraz\u00f3n Rockero<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a small part of chavismo\u2019s attempts to monopolize artistic content in Venezuela. It\u2019s a spin-off of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coraz\u00f3n Llanero<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a similar project I wrote about<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in 2017.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the statement went further, harshly attacking Venezuelan rock bands that don\u2019t identify with its position. Specifically, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coraz\u00f3n Rockero<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> went after Caramelos de Cianuro, one of the most mainstream rock bands in the country. Last month, they did a couple of street concerts in El Hatillo and Chacao neighborhoods of eastern Caracas (following social distancing regulations), giving free entertainment to those locked down in quarantine. While the band wasn\u2019t named explicitly, the disdain was obvious:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cNobody in his sane mind (or who didn&#8217;t have an obscure interest) would break this quarantine&#8230; Therefore it is surprising that in the last few days, a Venezuelan pop group, sponsored by a soft drink brand and which calls itself \u201crock\u201d, offered a concert in Caracas\u2026\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rafael Uzc\u00e1tegui, general coordinator of NGO Provea considers that <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coraz\u00f3n Rockero&#8217;s<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (or more directly Paul Gillman) uses this statement to criticize \u201cthe use of creative forms of protest, like rock music, by Venezuelan society.\u201d He mentions that since Ch\u00e1vez&#8217;s arrival to power, there have been more than 500 protest songs against the government, with 75% of them coming after 2014, when the first wave of demonstrations against Maduro took place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From Humano Derecho, a podcast later turned digital radio station, to the Music for Medicines festival, in which several bands offer their music in exchange for donations of medicines, along with an accompanying tour of several cities, Provea and Uzc\u00e1tegui have been promoting rock music not only as a way of airing grievances, but to build awareness and solidarity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But such work isn\u2019t free of risks: Last year, a Provea visual artist was briefly arrested by SEBIN for a \u201csubversive\u201d album cover for a punk compilation. Provea has been attacked recently by Maduro himself and other high-ranking government officials for being \u201cfunded by the CIA\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond the specifics, the role of the National Endowment for Democracy in Venezuela, along with related international cooperation entities, has been up for debate. Since the events of April<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2002, chavismo has accused the NED on multiple occasions of being part of the U.S. plans to overthrow it. Tim Gill particularly points out NED&#8217;s support of opposition political parties:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c(The NED) provides training for them<\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014<\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">helping them with their platforms, providing advice on how to reach out to chavistas and youth voters, providing advice on how to build websites. They bring in experts from the U.S. and elsewhere in the region to meet with opposition parties and strategize with them.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Uzc\u00e1tegui considers that, in this case, Gill&#8217;s arguments attempt to criminalize \u201cinternational cooperation,\u201d which go in line with the government&#8217;s hostility against NGOs, even if both Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro have benefitted from such international assistance. \u201cThere is a right to receive international cooperation, which helps states in the promotion of human rights.\u201d For the record, he makes it clear that Provea didn\u2019t receive money from NED, or other U.S. agencies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for how music has played a role in our crisis, last year&#8217;s benefit concert Venezuelan Aid Live was overshadowed by the events that followed it the day after, and although it raised 2.3 million dollars, it also failed to match the expectations it created. Meanwhile, at home, private concerts like last December&#8217;s CusicaFest in El Hatillo were successfully held by adapting to the de facto dollarization.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAs the government tries to invisibilize discontent, a movement of cultural resistance has been brewing in Venezuela,\u201d Uzc\u00e1tegui adds.

In the agreement, it isn\u2019t specified if the funds that are mentioned in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/vepresidente.com\/presidencia\/gobierno-interino-logra-acuerdo-que-permitira-a-la-ops-recibir-y-ejecutar-ayuda-humanitaria-frente-al-covid19-en-venezuela\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the statement by the National Communications Center of June 2nd <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, will be used or not.

Indeed, just a day after the signature, June 2nd, Maduro\u2019s regime raided the home of Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s parents. He\u2019s the special attorney general appointed by Guaid\u00f3.

On one hand, Maduro\u2019s regime, through its Supreme Tribunal of Justice (TSJ), is still recognizing former opposition deputy Luis Parra as the speaker of the National Assembly, after the fraudulent election of the new board of authorities in January, recently ratified by the Constitutional Chamber of the TSJ according to <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/historico.tsj.gob.ve\/decisiones\/scon\/mayo\/309867-0065-26520-2020-20-0001.HTML\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">decision N\u00ba 0065-2020<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on May 26th. Moreover, the dictatorship\u2019s narrative has been cautious about naming its counterpart on the agreement: Maduro\u2019s Foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, called them <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jaarreaza\/status\/1267966380290248704\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201ca part of the opposition G4\u201d<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the following day, he openly called them <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jaarreaza\/status\/1268331553345671168\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;the advisory team of the National Assembly&#8221;<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, Guaid\u00f3\u2019s government is still calling Maduro\u2019s regime a \u201cdictatorship\u201d, according to the National Communications Center statement on the agreement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Who supports this agreement?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The PAHO, that also works as the World Health Organization (WHO) regional office for the Americas.

This is such an important agreement because, as explained by the representative of the NGOs Acci\u00f3n Solidaria, Codevida and Civilis DDHH, Feliciano Reyna, the measure came at a critical moment, when the number of COVID-19 cases are exponentially increasing in Latin America. Although the rebound in Venezuela is slower than the rest of the region, the situation in the country is critical due to its complex humanitarian emergency. Malnutrition (whether it\u2019s caused by shortages, lack of production, import deficits or high costs), shortage of medicines, vaccines and medical equipment in the public and private health networks, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cinco8.com\/periodismo\/en-caracas-hay-mineros-pero-de-agua\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lack of access to water<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> make it even more difficult to fight the pandemic.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the national political crisis complicates efficiently managing the resources to tackle the emergency and the result calls for urgent action to prevent the upsurge of cases.
