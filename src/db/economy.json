The decision on July 2nd prompted immediate celebration from most of the Venezuelan opposition and ire from government circles. However, the effects of the decision are not clear.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the actual trial and decision lasting just under two weeks, the dispute over Venezuela\u2019s gold held inside the BoE has been brewing since late last year, when the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV) first sought out to repatriate around 14 tons of bullion.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to reports at the time, BoE officials first began to stall the request for repatriation<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a fairly routine exercise for any custodian<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">citing the difficulty and cost in obtaining insurance for the shipment. Indeed, assuming an underwriter had an even passing knowledge of what goes on in the Maiquet\u00eda airport, this decision is financially sound. But for a custodian such as the BoE, which had already conducted similar dealings with Caracas as early as 2012, insurance hurdles were an improbable excuse, and many industry watchers were quick to point that out.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several weeks later, in early November 2019, London-based news outlets elaborated on the matter, disclosing that British officials needed clarification on what the Venezuelan government intended to do with the bullion, adding that \u201cstandard measures to prevent money-laundering\u201d would need to be addressed. These reports came days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order under which, by all intents and purposes, Venezuelan dealings in the precious metal were censored.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This particular reasoning, assuming that the gold would be used to facilitate money laundering, even if correct<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is flawed too. The BoE has limited rights to enquire on what the end use of the gold would be, and the de facto freezing of a state\u2019s assets violates a number of custodian agreements and international law.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Already discounting procedural and legal arguments, the BoE\u2019s motivation behind its stall tactics were expanded upon in January 2020, when <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2019-01-25\/u-k-said-to-deny-maduro-s-bid-to-pull-1-2-billion-of-gold\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloomberg<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported that top U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and then National Security Advisor John Bolton, had lobbied their UK counterparts to cut Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s regime off its overseas assets. The BoE also received a number of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/static.bullionstar.com\/blogs\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Borges-Vecchio-Letter-to-the-BoE.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">public appeals<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by several opposition heavy weights to maintain the gold inside its vaults<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a plea that was echoed by UK backbench MPs.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The BoE has limited rights to enquire on what the end use of the gold would be, and the de facto freezing of a state\u2019s assets violates a number of custodian agreements and international law.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, once it became clear that neither the BoE nor HM Treasury would budge on the matter, the Venezuelan regime turned to the Commercial Court of the High Court Justice, arguing that the gold would finance coronavirus-related relief with the UN Development Programme (UNDP), which superficially appears to have played along with the excuse.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fast forward to the time of writing and Judge Nigel Teare&#8217;s unwillingness to father the first gold-PPE swap in financial history.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bailii.org\/ew\/cases\/EWHC\/Comm\/2020\/1721.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">decision<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Judge Teare referenced the so-called \u201cone voice\u201d doctrine, arguing that the court must accept as conclusive the political decision by the British government to recognize Guaid\u00f3 as the leader of Venezuela. This is despite the UK maintaining ties with the Venezuelan government by keeping an embassy in Caracas and continuing to have contact with the BCV. These arguments were dismissed by the court, which <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-latin-america-53262767\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stated <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that there was \u201cno room for recognition of Mr. Guaid\u00f3 as de jure president and of Mr. Maduro as de facto president.\u201d The judge, in other words, deferred to the UK government\u2019s political guidance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, first and foremost, the decision is a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/presidenciave.com\/presidencia\/comunicado-oficial-ante-la-decision-de-la-alta-corte-de-londres-que-reconoce-al-gobierno-legitimo-del-presidente-e-juan-guaido\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">win<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the Venezuelan opposition largely due to the regime\u2019s unadulterated history of corruption and mismanagement. Indeed, the notion that 100% of the gold would have gone to aid the government\u2019s coronavirus response is laughable to most Venezuelans. And even if it was transferred directly from London to UN headquarters in New York, one does not simply show up at the UNDP with a bag full of gold and expect PPE in return.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nevertheless, the decision doesn\u2019t immediately transfer the gold to the opposition either. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s camp would eventually need to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/in.reuters.com\/article\/venezuela-gold\/britain-recognises-guaido-as-venezuelas-president-in-gold-dispute-judge-rules-idINKBN2431PQ\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">petition<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the BoE and the court to become the legal representatives of the bullion. And given that the BoE custodian agreement isn\u2019t with the Venezuelan executive, but with the BCV, the bank and the court would now need to extend their recognition to the ad hoc BCV board named by Guaid\u00f3. Incidentally, all five members of the board now have Venezuelan <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.abc.es\/internacional\/abci-venezuela-emite-11-ordenes-detencion-contra-aliados-guaido-despojo-reino-unido-202007041538_noticia.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arrest<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> warrants.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assuming that the Guaid\u00f3-BCV issue is resolved in the near future, there are also domestic Venezuelan laws that would restrict the BCV\u2019s ability to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/es.euronews.com\/2020\/07\/06\/el-disputado-oro-de-venezuela-por-que-el-banco-de-inglaterra-ha-dado-las-reservas-a-guaido\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maneuver<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and deal with the bullion.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opposition can of course consider the ruling a fait accompli and attempt to knock on the door of the BoE tomorrow and ask for the gold to be handed over. However, what would be the likely response by an institution that has already set a precedent for asking too many questions and over-valuing political considerations? Would the BoE have reason to think that the opposition isn\u2019t frugal or financially adept at auditing its members? Would the BoE not consider what self-identified members of the opposition have condoned and supported in the past?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until the UK High Court takes up the matter again and decides on whether Guaid\u00f3\u2019s camp is the bullion\u2019s legal representative, the current limbo will persist.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While further exegesis of the law is required, Guaid\u00f3\u2019s legal team (which has <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dw.com\/es\/guaid%C3%B3-el-oro-ser%C3%A1-protegido-hasta-la-transici%C3%B3n-en-venezuela\/a-54047192\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">signalled<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that they don\u2019t seek to move the gold anytime soon) has indicated its willingness to consider the precedent set by the ruling and seek to at least freeze other foreign assets across Europe. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The caretaker government\u2019s Ambassador to the UK, Vanessa Neumann, has provided little detail on what specific assets they might target next, but the entire exercise <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">might be a little bit trickier than expected.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In recent years, the Venezuelan government has wound down numerous operations and assets across the continent in a bid to avoid U.S. sanctions, and politics in those specific countries might not be able to bend judicial decisions. Ms. Neumann admitted as much in an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.elnuevosiglo.com.co\/articulos\/06-2020-puja-por-oro-venezolano-hacia-un-fallo-politico-de-quilates\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interview<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with El Nuevo Siglo, stating: \u201cA legal ruling has much more weight than a political pronouncement and that should set a precedent for other foreign assets in Europe. That\u2019s what we are thinking. But let&#8217;s see, because between theory and practice (&#8230;) particularly when it comes to politics and money, there are always complications.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Setting \u201ccomplications\u201d aside, if the opposition is able to find and target other assets in friendly countries across Europe, further rulings like that of Judge Teare are likely on the pipeline.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the single silver lining, for now, is how the BoE has a pretty solid record as a custodian. Past custodians for countries which have seen large financial assets frozen have been more than permeable to corruption. Libya\u2019s wealth fund, for example, was frozen by the UN Security Council following the toppling of Muammar Qaddafi in 2011, but has seen leaks develop ever since, with large amounts of cash going missing in transactions that should have never been cleared by investment banks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The BoE, i<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">n contrast, holds bullion on a set-aside basis, so a clear record and weight list of each gold bar is likely available to Ms Neumann, and Guaido-backed BCV officials. The BoE also<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> facilitates gold lending in London using the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), to facilitate deposits and swaps. In this case, the original gold bars are taken by banks offering access to the financial instruments, but the banks and the BoE both have a liability to the customer. Hence, it is safe to assume that there won\u2019t be much leakage, or opportunities for corruption will at least be very limited.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, until the UK High Court takes up the matter again and decides on whether Guaid\u00f3\u2019s camp is the bullion\u2019s legal representative, the current limbo will persist. Another positive ruling for the opposition will, nevertheless, have a significant number of strings attached that might limit Guaid\u00f3\u2019s use of the funds. Avenues to change the likely status quo are beyond the scope of this particular article, but unless the opposition shortens the gap between them and the White House<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which would take considerable effort following the still beyond-words \u201cOperation Gede\u00f3n\u201d, and comes up with a credible excuse to use the funds, that bullion is not going anywhere.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s regime is officially barred from accessing the Venezuelan gold stored at the Bank of England.

But how much did they really bring in, and how long will it last?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In late May and early June, five Iranian tankers came to Venezuela without much trouble. Allegedly, they carried one and a half million fuel barrels, but the real number is a bit less, since they also brought additives and other by-products, like lubricants. It\u2019s not a big number if we consider the Venezuelan fuel usage, but this has dropped because of the prolonged quarantine and our own economic recession.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first, it was estimated that the Iranian fuel would last for about 40 days, but it will go on for longer because the economy is paralyzed and many can\u2019t afford the international price set for it. The government has prioritized Caracas and the rest of the country has to suffer on a larger or smaller scale. Recurring power outages in cities like M\u00e9rida and Maracaibo only make matters worse, since you can\u2019t pump fuel without electricity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>A tanker coming from Trinidad and Tobago came in April, carrying 150,000 barrels of fuel, which surprisingly led the Trinitarian parliament to open an investigation. This shipment helped ease the crisis for a few days. Another somewhat helpful bit is the current use of natural gas for vehicles (GNV), sold in some stations with the old, subsidized price tag. Since 2009, car assembly lines, importing companies, and dealers have to make sure that vehicles come with the GNV system in their engines, whether they use it or not.<\/p>\n<p><b>Gas stations are being expropriated now; what does this mean for the fuel distribution business in Venezuela?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>There are 1,680 gas stations in Venezuela on record. Many of them, however, have closed down in the past few years and PDVSA currently owns around 200. According to the Energy and Oil Ministry Resolution N\u00b0 013 from March 9<sup>th<\/sup>, 2009, gas stations are establishments with permits from the aforementioned ministry to retail fuel to end consumers. Retail sellers are commonly known as licensees. The facilities, as well as the storage and pumping equipment in these stations, are property of PDVSA, and the brand is PDVSA\u2019s. The real estate, meaning the plot of land and other assets, could be owned by the licensees. Well, last June, around 40 gas stations received a letter from PDVSA, telling them that their contract was being terminated. As a general rule, the Oil Ministry (not PDVSA) is the one with the authority to revoke permits, since fuel supply is a public service. This, of course, should also include the licensees\u2019 right to receive compensation for the early termination of permits, in response to money spent as investment and forecasted future earnings. This is a very delicate subject and we can\u2019t give a definite opinion, because with all certainty each licensee case is different and many of them could be the subjects of discrimination. If PDVSA is keeping the real estate, it would definitely be an expropriation, or even worse, a confiscation.<\/p>\n<p>The concept of an early termination of the license or permit in case of public interest is written in the country\u2019s legislation as a prerogative in the hands of the public administration that carries compensation for the licensee. The debate on whether the law was rightly applied in recent cases is ongoing; however, the early termination is a general principle in administrative law, traditionally recognized by Venezuelan courts.<\/p>\n<p><b>Is expropriating gas stations a sign that the regime is rebuilding the country\u2019s ability to produce and distribute fuel? Is there business in foreign currency to be made that the regime doesn\u2019t want to share with the private sector?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>We honestly don\u2019t see that trend. To have access to fuel, you need to import it or refine it locally. The regime has made some efforts on both fronts. But there is the question on whether this is sustainable in the long run. You can\u2019t underestimate its ability to jump over hurdles, even if it means more hardship for the Venezuelan people.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selling gasoline today at international prices is good business, although it can become scarce at some point, so we can\u2019t rule out the possibility of stations being operated directly by PDVSA, or reassigned to other dealers who can get permits.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Keep in mind that there\u2019s a restructuring plan for PDVSA, presumably prepared by the regime and exposed by the international press, although it hasn\u2019t been confirmed by an official source, and this plan recommended the gradual decrease of fuel subsidies, as well as the handing out of licenses to private companies to operate refineries.<\/p>\n<p>The regime is taking other actions too, like Decree N\u00b0 4,200 of May 29<sup>th<\/sup>, 2020, by which the Valued Added Tax, the Import Tax, and Customs Duties will be exonerated in regards to definitive imports and fuel sales, as well as on supplies and additives carried out by state, joint, and private companies. Nevertheless, according to the current statutes, neither joint companies nor private companies are allowed to import or sell fuel the way this decree indicates. For this to happen, Decree N\u00b0 1,648 of January 15<sup>th<\/sup>, 2002 and the Liquid Fuels Domestic Market Law would have to be modified.<\/p>\n<p><b>What can we expect from refineries? Is it true that they\u2019re trying to operate again with Iranian help?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Lack of official news from the government prevents us from having a clear image of what\u2019s going on in the refineries. It\u2019s true that PDVSA has been trying to recover the Amuay, Card\u00f3n, and El Palito refineries with the aid of Chinese, Iranian, and Venezuelan companies. Some reports say that these refineries are producing around 140,000 barrels of gas per day.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: 0.001rem;\">The first obstacle to normal activity is the technology used in these facilities. Most of it came from the U.S., since they were built by Exxon, Shell, and Mobil, with help from American engineering companies. You would also need highly qualified management and technical teams, together with expensive maintenance plans so the operation continues successfully over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: 0.001rem;\">Then there\u2019s the downwards trend in Venezuelan oil production. Chances are that the government will need to sell all of that oil abroad in order to obtain foreign currency, or to pay debts to key creditors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Can we assume that, from now on, fuel will be paid in dollars at gas stations?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>We believe so. In any case, you can still pay in bolivars at the official exchange rate given by the Central Bank. Many establishments have points of sale and, despite the economic sanctions that Venezuela has on its shoulders, the U.S. dollar has become a common form of payment in supermarkets, bakeries, pharmacies, hardware stores, and now in non-subsidized gas stations. Venezuelans receive remittances, dollar payments for services or sales, or they\u2019re using up their savings in foreign currency. You also have cases in which people use credit cards and are taking up debt in dollars.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This system encourages, no doubt, the black market within the country and smuggling into neighboring countries. These methods won\u2019t disappear, but uncertainty is the norm.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Since the bolivar has lost all its value and the law allows for payments in foreign currency, we believe that the dollar will still be the preferred currency for Venezuelans. This could become a problem if the U.S. imposes new sanctions, forbidding the use of electronic payment services in dollars through the Venezuelan financial system, for example. But, the U.S. can\u2019t prevent the use of its currency in Venezuela entirely.<\/p>\n<p><b>Are there still incentives for smuggling? Will we continue to depend on fuel sold in the black market?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Right now there\u2019s a twofold pricing system that has been going on for barely a month. 1,360 gas stations supply subsidized fuel through a system controlled by the last number on license plates. This system encourages, no doubt, the black market within the country and smuggling into neighboring countries. These methods won\u2019t disappear, but uncertainty is the norm.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: 0.001rem;\">Fuel smuggling into neighboring countries did stop during March, April and May, because fuel was only available inside Venezuela at black market (exploitative) prices. Today, 120 liters of fuel per car and 60 per motorcycle, each month, at a ridiculously low price of BsS. 5,000 per liter, provides a great opportunity for smugglers and resellers. Public transport and freight vehicles are completely subsidized for at least 90 days. The price difference with the international price of $0.5 is huge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: 0.001rem;\">By the way, we still haven\u2019t seen the new fuel prices in the Official Gazette, as it should be done according to the Hydrocarbons Law.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How close are we to the extinction of lines at gas stations?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not close at all.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Right now, there\u2019s no hint of lines ending outside the capital any time soon, and since we haven\u2019t received any more fuel imports, the country could go through another severe shortage in the short term. Some gas stations outside Caracas aren\u2019t getting fuel anymore and those who live in other states have to endure the long lines, especially for subsidized fuel during restricted schedules, and in an environment where there\u2019s an alarming rise in COVID-19 cases. A close look has to be put on a new development since the Venezuelan government is now trying to import more than 1.1 million barrels of Iranian fuel, apparently in route, while the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, issued a warrant last week for its seizure following a complaint by the U.S. government.<\/p>\n<p>In our opinion, the oil industry\u2019s administration model is exhausted. Venezuela should sanction a new oil legislation that allows far-reaching private investment. The bitter confrontation between the regime, the U.S. and the EU, as well as the upcoming parliament elections, are not helping in the resolution of this situation at all.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s been over a month since the Iranian fuel tankers brought gasoline to our country.

Their red color blazed against the fire and when you opened them up, the aroma of sweet chili peppers would serve as a preview of the savory pleasure. A warm arepa was the perfect companion for this delicacy produced by a simple <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">margarite\u00f1o<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that didn\u2019t dream of being a chef.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I haven\u2019t had that gastronomic delight in years. I haven\u2019t even seen a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">catalana<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or any other fleshy red snapper, let alone the delicate, juicy groupers, because regardless of what we catch in Margarita, we always get the short end of the stick.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What you see in the markets are small fish, whose names are only known by the well versed. Fishermen have to pay a high price to work with fishnets, lines, and hooks. They depend on the black market to get fuel and engine oil. The drop in locals\u2019 purchasing power, plus the chance of selling fish in dollars offshore, have caused fishermen to sell their best fish to whoever has dollars. So most <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">margarite\u00f1os<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have to settle for not-so-appetizing fish that get caught in the nets.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Dollar Decides<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFishing falls under the laws of supply and demand, even for humble fishermen,\u201d says Walter Gonz\u00e1lez, professor at the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Escuela de Ciencias Aplicadas del Mar (School for Applied Sea Sciences)<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the Marine Biology program of the Universidad de Oriente. The variation in the availability of marine species for consumption, he says, is caused by how they\u2019re marketed offshore: \u201cSome species are very sought after, like the red snapper, the grouper, or even the mackerel, that are now rarely served in Margarita because they\u2019re taken to other islands; they\u2019re more valuable in Trinidad and Tobago, for example. There\u2019s a high variety of edible fish here, like blue fishes: tuna, pompano, mackerel, sawfish, sardines. But those with a high commercial value, don\u2019t even reach our docks.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The researcher also claims that high load capacity boats anchor by the islands of Los Testigos and Los Frailes, waiting for fishermen from Margarita and Sucre who head over there to offer their products, which are then sold abroad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fishing production has certainly continued in Margarita, it\u2019s just that for the regular <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">margarite\u00f1o,<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the fish that they were used to eating has become harder to purchase, because of their availability and price. People are inclined to buy sardines or skates, while red snapper or groupers are way beyond their means. That means that the balance of supply and demand is off, according to Gonz\u00e1lez.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_80949\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"max-width: 2570px;\" itemprop=\"image\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/ImageObject\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/20171210-110314.jpg\" data-fancybox=\"image\"><img data-attachment-id=\"80949\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2020\/07\/02\/no-more-fancy-fish-in-margarita\/20171210-110314\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/20171210-110314.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2560,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.6&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;GT-I8190L&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1512903793&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;3.54&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.016666&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"20171210-110314\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/20171210-110314-300x225.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/20171210-110314-1024x768.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-80949 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/20171210-110314.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/20171210-110314.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/20171210-110314-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/20171210-110314-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/20171210-110314-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/20171210-110314-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/20171210-110314-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/a><figcaption itemprop=\"caption\"><h6>Even at ports where the fishermen dock, what\u2019s available goes to a preferential market that values the fish at a higher price than what regular folk can afford.

He goes every week to El Tirano, once one of the most important ports in the island, to buy fish or to trade it for flour, rice, or pasta. \u201cYou don\u2019t see the fishermen boats like before, filled to the brim with red snapper, mackerel, sawfish, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cuna<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> grouper, barracudas or <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">medregal <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tuna,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to buy a kilo of good fish at the beach if you only have bolivars. The refrigerated trucks and the cold rooms near the beach are first in line for purchase, because they\u2019re the ones providing fishermen with engine oil and fuel.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhat you\u2019ll find is second rate fish, what the regular <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">margarite\u00f1o<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> buys, in bolivars or bartering: yellowhead jawfish, white grunt, megrim, crevalle jack, yellow jack, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guatacara<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cataco<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, whitespotted filefish, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cachama<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guaquinillo<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arar\u00e1<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> white grunt. In the Los Frailes islands, you\u2019ll see a different scenario, where high-end boats spend the night and then buy the best fish to take to the smaller islands: Trinidad, Martinique, St. Lucia, Guadalupe, St. Vincent. All paid in dollars.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAt other important ports, like Manzanillo, fishing is done with nets, so the yellow jack, pompano, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">carachana pintada<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, catfish, white grunt, and sardine are common. We\u2019re talking about a catch of between 20 to 70 tonnes per casting. The same thing happens there, the best fish are sold outside of the island, while the owners of the fishing trains and machinery give the residents some of what they catch; that noble gesture, as we call it here, has helped us against hunger for the last five years.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mar\u00eda Tineo is a teacher and member of a fishing family. She says that traditional fishing has become a threat, as it was during the bottom-trawling fishing period, because boats and refrigerated trucks get all the fish, including the small ones that haven\u2019t finished growing, endangering the reproduction for these species.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fishermen have another threat to deal with: crime. Those spending the night in Los Frailes run the risk to save fuel, because their engines and even their food can be stolen. Many fishermen who have been robbed leave the trade or quit to try their luck into the high seas, where the best fish can be caught.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lesly Indriago is a young fisherwoman. She started when she was 14 years old, quitting school for a job that provides enough income. She used to spend the night in Los Frailes, along with her partner and small children. Last month, a group of armed masked men raided her family\u2019s quarters, stole four engines, and their food supply. \u201cMy kids were screaming non-stop. We can\u2019t stay there anymore.\u201d But Lesly has another problem: she has no boat or engine, so she was taken off the list of those allowed to buy fuel. \u201cI can borrow from someone, but what\u2019s the point if I don\u2019t have fuel? Plus, there\u2019s also the risk of my fishing train (a large fishing net) getting stolen, because that beach gets very lonely.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fishermen have another threat to deal with: crime. <\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On July 1<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">st<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the octopus season began, even though some fishermen were already fishing them, taking the risk of confiscation by the National Guard. Merchants are selling it for $2.10 per kilo. Once the legal season begins, the battle to settle on a price by the truck owners begins. Octopus is sold by the sack to the cold rooms which store and pile it up until the season is closed, and then sell it at a better price. Fishermen will give away a few to those helping pull the boat to shore, then they sell it to small merchants and the product becomes available before the truck owners monopolize it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Octopus season is a period of relative prosperity because it brings a lot of people to the beach, and neighbors go and sell cakes, desserts, bracelets or necklaces.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you aren\u2019t lucky enough to buy good fish at the ports, you can go to the Los Cocos Market, in Porlamar. You\u2019ll find everything, because that\u2019s where the truck owners trade.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clams and Mussels Are Getting Scarce<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tripa \u2018e perla <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">clam that used to be sold by women door to door at very low prices, is now very rare.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The banks where several bivalve species live are located between the island of Cubagua and Punta de Piedras: there, the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pata \u2018e cabra<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> clam, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tripa \u2018e perla<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> clam, West Indian fighting conch, Mother of Pearl, mussels and other species are extracted. They\u2019re taken to Punta de Piedras where the largest group of shellers (who boil and open the shells) are found.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pedro Garc\u00eda states that this is caused by two reasons;\u00a0 first, the mollusc banks are running out due to over-exploitation, since more fishermen see them as a way to make a living, with their high demand; second, there\u2019s a low supply of engine oil, fuel, and parts for outboard motorboats. These hurdles steer the fisherman towards large head hairtails, for example, which are pricier, or macro algae, sought after by Koreans, which are exported from the island.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019re talking about a catch of between 20 to 70 tonnes per casting. The same thing happens there, the best fish are sold outside of the island.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Walter Gonz\u00e1lez adds that the traditional way of extracting clams and other molluscs, called raking, is very aggressive and it can destroy their natural banks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even at ports where the boats dock, what\u2019s available goes to a preferential market that values them at a much higher price than what regular folk can afford. In Manzanillo, where mussels are extracted, a favored snack at parties and events, you used to get them by the sack between July and August. This species, which isn\u2019t very common in its natural habitat, has also decreased its number because of human predators and its price. You can run into the scuba divers near noon, arriving with half a sack or less, offering them for $4 a kilo already shelled, or $1.50 closed. Having a plate of mussel soup with margarite\u00f1o chili peppers is almost a memory now.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Largehead Hairtail Case<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2017, the Fishing and Aquaculture Ministry (<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ministerio del Poder Popular de Pesca y Acuicultura)<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> limited the permits given to export largehead hairtail, to bring down prices and protect the hydro biological resources from over-exploitation.\u00a0 High demand for this species, that used to be handed out to those who helped pull the fishing train, made its price go up even above the mackerel\u2019s.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Professor Walter Gonz\u00e1lez, Chinese factories in Margarita fix the price in dollars and then export it. The trucks take it to Porlamar, where it\u2019s cleaned up and packaged. But they also take octopus, squid, red snapper and grouper.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Gonz\u00e1lez, China and Japan have run down the largehead hairtail across the world. They\u2019ve fished it excessively because they\u2019re very sought after in their traditional cuisine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Renowned chef Rub\u00e9n Santiago, creator of the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pastel de chucho<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, expresses his amazement at the prices that the largehead hairtail has reached, along with the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">catalana<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> red snapper: \u201cThe largehead hairtail was barely eaten and it reached astronomical prices; people forgot what it is to eat a largehead hairtail. The smooth puffer fish, which used to bother fishermen because it swallows the fish hook, has disappeared today because it has a very particular meat. Same thing happens with the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">medregal<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tuna, red snapper, grouper, shrimp, squid.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santiago acknowledges that, despite the high prices, his restaurant carries on with its job. \u201cToday, a kilo of mackerel goes for between $4 and $5, same as red snapper, but we pay whatever the cost is because customers ask for those dishes.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rub\u00e9n claims that \u201cin Caracas, you find fish markets where prices are like Cartier\u2019s\u201d. Chances are that they carry those tasty species that fishermen in Margarita pick out for the ice trucks, taking them away from the island.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The dollar dynamics have changed the fishing industry on the island.

Other upcoming privatizations have shown their heads on the horizon, individually chosen to favor the corrupt and their front friends. Carabobo&#8217;s flamboyant state governor, Rafael Lacava, said in November 2019 that \u201cit\u2019s necessary to privatize the electric power service\u201d at rates that represent \u201cwhat electricity is worth\u201d (meaning: rates that are profitable).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s easy to imagine what chavismo<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has in store for the Venezuelan economy, now that it has pretty much stopped producing oil (since hydrocarbon exports and refining have dropped to historic lows). The economy will depend, in good measure, on money laundering from corruption, drug dealing, gold mining, and assorted shady businesses. This answers to a folding-back-logic at a time when dirty civilian and military agents are having trouble moving their money around the world thanks to the sanctions imposed by the U.S. Treasury Department, and controls by the European Union.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Pressed and Clean<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The so-called \u201cbodegones\u201d were a relatively successful experiment to dollarize sales until the COVID-19 pandemic arrived. Without generalizing, some of these stores, filled with delicacies, American candy bars, liquors, and many other imported products, have been relatively small money-laundering machines. The same could be said about some construction projects in Caracas. But the big deal will be privatizing public services with dollarized fares.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The big deal will be privatizing public services with dollarized fares.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The money coming from corruption and illegal businesses is already there. The ability to import Chinese technology, as well as Turkish, Russian, and Iranian tech and commodities is also there, with evident political will (proven by Iran in our fuel shortage). The social context is favorable. Repression, propaganda, censorship, food extorsion (through systems like <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CLAP)<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the incarceration of opposition figures and citizens who demonstrate, the existence of paramilitary groups and brutality by police and army officers that have subdued the \u201cbrave people.\u201d There are also incentives for money laundering in Venezuela. The corrupt individuals associated with chavismo know that their properties and bank accounts in the United States, Europe, and other countries could be confiscated. Venezuela, under the umbrella of Maduro\u2019s regime, is a safe haven to invest and have a foreign currency return. Besides, they\u2019re offered participation in highly profitable enterprises like drug, mineral, and human trafficking, and the now \u201clegal\u201d trade of gasoline in dollars (and in the near future, public services).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>How Criminal Authoritarianism i<\/b><b>s Financed<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the end, these corrupt regimes depend on poverty. We can look in the mirror of Cuba, post-Soviet Russia, or even the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to understand how power mafias are constantly reinventing themselves. In the case of Cuba, a systematic parasitic policy is in place, first under the protection of the USSR in the midst of the Cold War, and later under Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, allowing the communist dictatorship to survive while it keeps the Cubans in misery. For this, it counts on the support of a martial caste that handles the consortium of military companies GAESA, which is in charge of the tourism activity on the island, among other things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-communist Russia is an example of how the old Soviet <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nomenklatura <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(the equivalent of the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chavista <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201celite\u201d) can transform into capitalist oligarchs\u2014what the anthropologist Alexei Yurchak called the \u201cperformative change\u201d in his research about the end of the Soviet Union. Putin, a former KGB agent turned into an autocrat with Tsar-like aspirations, has been able to take out some of these oligarchs when they opposed his hegemonic policies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The RDC, a country plagued by wars and epidemics, is dramatic evidence that \u201cthe show must (and can) go on\u201d thanks to the exploitation of mineral resources, particularly the coveted coltan, destroying the environment and causing brutal violence among paramilitary forces that have resulted in thousands of deaths.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>When Will It End?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everything points to privatizations turning into economic support for the regime. Shady privatizations, without open bids. They will allow dark capitals to enter the country, reproduce, and legitimize in Venezuela and other allied countries like Iran, Russia, China, and Turkey. It will be a privatization that will benefit the same civil and military oligarchy. A huge majority will continue to be impoverished, subject to the \u201c<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arepa<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> muzzle,\u201d a Venezuelan version of The Hunger Games.

Like he was glad he was losing control of the currency people use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the problem with entropy is its very nature: people are not only using dollars, they\u2019re using the first thing that sort of works to keep life going. For some, that\u2019s dollars in cash; for others, the Colombian peso, Brazilian reais, or actual gold nuggets, Zelle transfers or a combination of all the above.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some businesses are taking this a step further and straight up rejecting bolivars, which is discriminatory as hell. Imagine going to a clinic, with your Banco de Venezuela debit card, and being told that you have to have a dollar account in the U.S. to pay because they switched to Zelle now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now picture that scenario, but with even more limited options to make transactions in dollars. The alarms are going off in Venezuela, as many Wells Fargo customers have been receiving messages from the bank saying that, starting June 26th, they will remove the option to send and receive Zelle payments. Apparently, the termination of the service is for Wells Fargo accounts domiciled in Venezuela. It isn\u2019t clear yet if other banks will follow, or if it will extend to other Venezuelan Wells Fargo customers. Also, it\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s due to overcompliance with sanctions, like the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2019\/10\/31\/surviving-adobecalypse\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adobe case<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (which was solved), or simply an internal decision of the bank because dealing with accounts held by Venezuelans is expensive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the point here is that, in this chaotic blizzard, there\u2019s no alternative that works for everyone.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or is there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last Friday I received a message:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHey, we have this new app that allows people in Venezuela to have a dollar account, and we want your mom to test it!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine going to a clinic, with your Banco de Venezuela debit card, and being told that you have to have a dollar account in the U.S. to pay because they switched to Zelle now.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The message came from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valiu.com\/\">Valiu<\/a>, a startup in Colombia that wants to allow <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">everyone <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in Venezuela to have access to a dollar account through their phone, no U.S. bank account required.

Because of international regulations, every app that deals with money must have your basic info. I\u2019ve seen this many times, just not via WhatsApp.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mom doesn\u2019t use a computer and her only contact with the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">internets <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is through her android phone from 2016, where she uses WhatsApp and, recently, Twitter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She\u2019s 57, and even though she\u2019s one of these vampire people that don\u2019t look their age, when she uses her phone, it shows!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adding <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valiu<\/span><\/i><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given how I\u2019m very into crypto, I\u2019m no stranger to wallet app solutions that promise to help us with our hyperinflating currency and allow us to bypass the authoritarian controls.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back in November, I went to the Meridian Conference in Mexico City, where I met many people from the world of cryptocurrencies. These guys are well aware that the bolivar is close to extinction, and they\u2019re racing each other to offer the next thing that replaces the void.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though they\u2019re based in Colombia, they\u2019re Venezuelan. You don\u2019t have to explain to these guys why a currency based on scanning QR codes wouldn\u2019t work around here.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are some really good apps out there, and I\u2019ve tried pretty much all of them, but they always had a dealbreaker. Some needed too much memory, some weren\u2019t compatible with older phones, some had a transfer fee that was too high, and some had things like passphrases you have to write in paper (which people don\u2019t want to do), or used a currency that isn\u2019t super stable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I met Simon, one of the founders of Valiu,\u00a0 in the conference (Alejandro was there too, but I already knew him from Caracas Chronicles). Valiu stands out to me because, even though they\u2019re based in Colombia, they\u2019re Venezuelan. You don\u2019t have to explain to these guys why a currency based on scanning QR codes wouldn\u2019t work around here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While my mom struggles to send the pictures, the messages in WhatsApp are piling up. Alejandro is sending the next steps of the process and, since this is a beta version of the app, he wants my mom\u2019s email to give her beta tester permissions to download and try out the app from Google Play.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mom doesn\u2019t even know she has a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cgemail.\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I have to help her out with this, as Alejandro explains that this step won\u2019t be necessary when the app launches officially.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our internet has been specially bad since the quarantine started, so the 13 mb app takes about 30 minutes to download.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we open it, the first option is to create an account. It asks for a phone number, and then it tells you to wait for a code via SMS.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSMS is a text message, right?\u201d my mom asks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The message never comes, so we come back to WhatsApp. We didn\u2019t notice, but Alejandro told her that the codes would be sent via WhatsApp instead, to better protect user privacy. All she had to do was send him a screenshot of the app.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crossing this bridge takes my mom a while (and I have to help her out again), but once that\u2019s done, the app asks for some basic information like your date of birth, and that\u2019s that. Alejandro promptly sends her $5, and a notification pops up saying that, besides the five bucks, she also has a complimentary $1 in her account, so that\u2019s $6 in total.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mom is excited, but also not: \u201cOkay, this is great, but how am I going to use these $5? Do they accept these in stores?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not Voodoo Magic<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s a great question. This is the part where most cryptocurrency solutions fail. Your cryptocurrency can have a million cool cryptofeatures, but if I can\u2019t spend it, it\u2019s useless. With so many restrictions in Venezuela, liquidity is probably the hardest feature to pull off.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOkay, this is great, but how am I going to use these $5? Do they accept these in stores?\u201d<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We take a look at the app and it has two options at the main screen: exchange pesos to bolivars, and send bolivars to a Venezuelan account using dollars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mom goes to the second option, and the app lets you choose the amount to send. She puts the whole 6$.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The app asks for the name of the person you\u2019re sending money to. She writes down her own. Now you have to pick your bank from a list and write the banking information.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She hits send and the app says that the money will be in the bank account in three hours, or less.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turns out, the app works as promised. We didn\u2019t get to try the feature of sending money to other Valiu users, but it seems simple enough, kind of like sending a WhatsApp message.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To people familiar with sending money to Venezuela, this should sound like voodoo magic; the usual process has you converting the money with some trader you found on Instagram or something, and sending bolivars directly. The person in Venezuela always receives bolivars, and never has the power to hold any hard currency, which is a shame, because keeping hard currency is \u201csurviving hyperinflation 101\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This whole process takes my mom about two hours. After we\u2019re done, Alejandro sends me the invite link so I can try out the app, too. Excluding the half hour it took to download the app, the process took me two minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So yeah, getting a highly functional dollar account in Venezuela can now take you between two minutes, or two hours, depending on how good you are with technology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And it\u2019s not voodoo magic, it\u2019s just Bitcoin.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A Colombia-based startup developed an app that would allow Venezuelans to engage in electronic transactions in dollars without having a bank account in the U.S. Too good to be true?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":31,"featured_media":80782,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":""},"categories":[1006],"tags":[863,846],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/IMG_3950.jpg","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.0.4 -

It was the answer to the decision by AT&amp;T to cease the operations of its pay-TV provider, DirecTV, in Venezuela on May 19<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The measure affected approximately one-third of the Venezuelan population.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first week after DirecTV left Venezuela, people from the Andes states of T\u00e1chira and M\u00e9rida (bordering with Colombia) checked their WhatsApp statuses and noticed that, beside the regular offers of foreign currency and food, black-market traders were now offering Colombian DirecTV prepaid kits. Apart from the equipment, they also offered the possibility to recharge credit with payments in bolivars (through transfers or SMS), or Zelle transfers in dollars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In just a few days, this new satellite TV option reached Caracas. Dealers have set up shop outside of the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Universidad Central de Venezuela<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and around downtown, selling the prepaid Colombian kits\u2014at a higher price than those sold closer to the border, of course. In Caracas, a kit goes for $90, as opposed to the price in T\u00e1chira, which is 150,000 Colombian pesos, or $45. Even with the transport costs, these sellers are making a big profit, since this very kit in Colombia goes for 49,900 pesos, or $15.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The kit is also sold in Maracaibo and Valencia, and the recharge credit is $20. Not everyone can afford this, of course, because the minimum wage in Venezuela is 800,000 bolivars ($4.1). You\u2019d have to work for five months straight without spending a dime in order to afford a month of cable.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everything Is a Business Opportunity<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In February 2003, in an attempt to avoid the flight of capital as a result of the oil strike, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s administration announced the implementation of a system of exchange controls and formed the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Administraci\u00f3n de Divisas <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(CADIVI), the institution that would be in charge of handling foreign currency and allowing citizens\u2019 access to it, under certain conditions and limitations.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019d have to work for five months straight without spending a dime in order to afford a month of cable.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Between 2008 and mid-2013, Venezuelans got intimately acquainted with the CADIVI quota, in which the government would give preferential dollars in cash and credit cards, and the price paid for them was a fraction of the black-market value. Some people traveled, others went shopping online, and others sold their quota in Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, and Peru, through payments made to their bank accounts in bolivars. The dollar wasn\u2019t a hot commodity yet; CADIVI turned into the most profitable business in pre-hyperinflation Venezuela.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When CADIVI&#8217;s subsidized dollar flickered off and shortages exploded, the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBachaquero\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> industry began. On January 24<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of 2014, the Organic Law of Fair Prices <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Ley Org\u00e1nica de Precios Justos)<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> came into effect, under the premise of controlling \u201ccosts, profit, and determining a fair price through the analysis of cost framework and establishing a maximum profit percentage, as well as the timely audit of the economic commercial activity.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maduro ordered his government agents to supervise supermarket chains, drug stores, and bodegas to make sure they complied with the ridiculously low established prices. The law resulted in a deep shortage of basic goods, since most companies didn&#8217;t see a reason to continue production if it wasn\u2019t profitable anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there was a group that did see a way to profit from the new regulation. Men and women bought a bag of rice, to name an item, for 450 bolivars, to later sell it at 1,500; milk was bought at 800, sold for 3,000; diapers bought at 100, and later sold for 1,500. That\u2019s why on a daily basis, or as often as their ID number would allow, they\u2019d go to stores at the break of dawn, hoping to buy what little came in. According to polls from Datan\u00e1lisis, 70% of people that stood in line outside Venezuelan supermarkets in 2016, would do this for a living.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Terms like <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cbachaquero\u201d <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201ctrusted bachaquero\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (words that derive from <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cbachaco\u201d,<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the local term for the carpenter ant) became common, in spite of the government threatening these resellers with three to five years of jail time for smuggling.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">70% of people that stood in line outside Venezuelan supermarkets in 2016, would do this for a living.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the exchange crimes regulation was modified and softened<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in August 2018, and as a consequence of hyperinflation, many Venezuelans began to earn dollars. The flow of the black-market dollar was reversed, and a new type of informal entrepreneur appeared: dollar buyers, who live off buying dollars in cash or by transfer, keeping a percentage. <\/span>With the transactional dollarization in place, and a truce between the Maduro administration and farmers and businessmen, the prices for food and other basic needs started to come closer to their real value\u2014resellers became just another number in the contact list.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shortages create needs and incentives to profit from them. For example, everything that\u2019s needed in public and private hospitals (from albumina to needles, from solutions to cancer medicine) is traded in the black market. And now, another illegal business taking flight is reselling gas, due to the shortage that became critical during the COVID-19 quarantine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before May 30<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, when Maduro announced the two-tier system to sell fuel (5,000 bolivars per liter for subsidized gasoline, and $0.50 per liter without subsidies), some people made a living by reselling fuel charging from $2 to $3 per liter\u2014the official price per<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> liter of 0.00006 bolivars (super premium) and 0.00001 per liter (premium). Before the massive shortage, there was no physical nor digital way to pay for gasoline. Some people would pay gas station workers with crackers, and there are stories of folks taking mangos from trees to fill their gas tanks. When the gas ran out, resellers would make a $60 profit from just 20 liters (5.2 gallons).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These stories, and others, sum up how whenever a candle goes out in Venezuela, someone can come and turn it back on, charging three times the price for that small service.
