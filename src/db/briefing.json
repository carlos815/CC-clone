The boat that transported the aid and three Colombian crew members \u201cwere captured by Venezuelan military,\u201d said people from the area. They added that the Venezuelan Army constantly exploits merchants in the area. The Colombian Foreign Ministry denounced the confiscation of hygiene kits and food and that Colombian citizens had been detained. They demand their immediate release and respect for their integrity. They rejected and condemned \u201can act that violates the right of navigation common rivers, that interrupted a humanitarian action amid a pandemic.\u201d Jorge Arreaza, Nicol\u00e1s\u2019s Foreign minister, responded with a communiqu\u00e9 saying that they were carrying \u201c38 barrels of gas that occupied 80% of the boat\u201d and scolded the Norwegian Refugee Council and the Red Cross. He said they\u2019ll deliver the aid but, because of the alleged crimes committed, the boat and the crew will be taken to Venezuelan court.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jorge Arreaza issued another communiqu\u00e9 to condemn recent statements by the Commander of the U.S. Southern Command and the USS Pinckney navigating \u201cso close\u201d to Venezuela, 16.1 nautical miles off our shores. Admiral Craig Faller announced on June 15th, that the U.S. is acting lawfully, navigating international waters and that Nicol\u00e1s\u2019s regime illegally claims control of the waters well beyond our borders (12 nautical miles) and that the American warship was sailing the Caribbean.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Thursday, 426 new COVID-19 cases in Venezuela were announced, which brings us to a total of 10,854 contagions. In addition, four more patients died (the pandemic has caused a total of 104 deaths). However, deputy in exile Jos\u00e9 Manuel Olivares, assured yesterday that there are 72 deaths that haven\u2019t been reported in the official figures and that 22 of those were health workers. The PAHO issued an epidemiology warning reporting that there are 152 indigenous patients, with Bol\u00edvar being the state with the most cases (96), followed by Zulia (43, and one death); Amazonas (12), and Delta Amacuro (1). The chief of cardio at the P\u00e9rez Carre\u00f1o Hospital, in Caracas, Juan P\u00e9rez Ter\u00e1n, has resigned. He didn\u2019t want to send residents without protection gear to the coronavirus isolation area. The commander of Zulia\u2019s Integral Defense Operational Area also resigned after confirming on a voice note that he has coronavirus.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Journalist Otilio Rodr\u00edguez, detained on Wednesday for saying that the National Guard is allegedly involved in illegal sale of gas in Sucre state, was released yesterday. During his detention, he wasn\u2019t allowed to see his family or lawyers. He was charged with promoting hate and ordered to attend court for eight months, which he will have to do when the quarantine is over.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Journalist Johan \u00c1lvarez said that DGCIM officers told Nicmer Evans\u2019s wife that he was held at the Bole\u00edta headquarters and that she could bring him food and clothes. When she got there they told her that it wasn\u2019t a visitation day. Nobody has been able to check his health condition. Evans is hypertensive and requires medicine. They wouldn\u2019t take the medicine from his wife. He hasn\u2019t been taken to court either, even though it\u2019s been over 48 hours since his detention.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Judge Mar\u00eda Lourdes Afiuni\u2019s home was raided with the goal of \u201cfinding and confiscating explosives, guns and vehicles,\u201d according to the warrant. Journalist Nelson Bocaranda said that the action was meant to find Afiuni\u2019s daughter, who\u2019s in the U.S. (under political asylum), for working with former Attorney General Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez. Judge Afiuni is one of the most well known political prisoners, because she was tortured, mistreated and raped in prison with the knowledge of many authorities.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Former Attorney General Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez denied that the Delaware court has asked for information: \u201cActually, Avanzada Progresista\u2019s representatives presented a document full of mistakes and lies. They want to rewrite history favoring Maduro, and give him more excuses to persecute,\u201d he wrote.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cape Verdean law doesn\u2019t allow the Venezuelan regime\u2019s legal intervention in the extradition process of Colombian citizen Alex Saab, alleged middleman of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and wanted by the U.S. justice, said Cape Verdean lawyer Arnaldo Silva to Efe yesterday. The Venezuelan Executive tried to hire Silva to assist on the case, but as he explained to Efe: \u201cI let them know that wasn\u2019t possible because in the due process the Venezuelan government has no legitimacy for any kind of intervention in the process.\u201d The lawyer said that in the process, Saab won\u2019t have a trial in Cape Verde, only a decision will be made on the request for extradition presented by the U.S. and already backed by the Executive and \u201chaving a result will take a long time.\u201d Silva emphasized this case is judicially complex and it\u2019s subject to many requests of appeal and has a lot of media attention.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding the new report on Venezuela by High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet, the under secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs, Michael Kozak, said that \u201cVenezuelans deserve a peaceful road to democracy and prosperity, as it was stated in the Democratic Transition Framework.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American company of Latino products Goya Foods announced a donation of 220,000 pounds (99.790 kgs) of food for Venezuelans affected by the pandemic, as part of the company\u2019s global campaign.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Argentinian president Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez clarified his position on human rights in Venezuela. He said he never disregarded Nicol\u00e1s\u2019s legitimacy but that \u201cArgentina ratified its position of always preserving human rights, in any field and any government.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arreaza asked the UN to make decisions to stop U.S. sanctions, during the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, a space that should be denied to a regime that forces an entire country to go through a complex humanitarian emergency.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carlos Vecchio said last night that the U.S. government presented documents to the Delaware court, favoring the defense and protection of CITGO, reinforcing that the caretaker government allows the distinction and considers the Venezuelan State and CITGO to be different judicial entities.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Allegedly, the army interrupted a delivery of humanitarian aid from Noruega to a vulnerable population in Colombia;
