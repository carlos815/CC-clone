Her aunt and uncle were left without pesos too, even though they had spent more time in Colombia, and were also forced to leave. \u201cIf we ate, we couldn\u2019t pay rent. If we paid a month\u2019s rent, then we couldn\u2019t eat.

This makes sense because the rapid antibody test used to screen them can be falsely negative during the early and most contagious time of infection.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">But this also means that some people entering the quarantine shelters may be infected and, without adequate protections, could easily spread COVID-19 to others. Many quarantine shelters, which range from hotels to stadiums to abandoned schools, are overcrowded and people face unsanitary conditions, including difficulty accessing water.

These reports came days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order under which, by all intents and purposes, Venezuelan dealings in the precious metal were censored.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This particular reasoning, assuming that the gold would be used to facilitate money laundering, even if correct</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">,</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> is flawed too. The BoE has limited rights to enquire on what the end use of the gold would be, and the de facto freezing of a state\u2019s assets violates a number of custodian agreements and international law.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Already discounting procedural and legal arguments, the BoE\u2019s motivation behind its stall tactics were expanded upon in January 2020, when </span><a href=\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-25/u-k-said-to-deny-maduro-s-bid-to-pull-1-2-billion-of-gold\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Bloomberg</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> reported that top U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and then National Security Advisor John Bolton, had lobbied their UK counterparts to cut Nicol\xe1s Maduro\u2019s regime off its overseas assets.

This is despite the UK maintaining ties with the Venezuelan government by keeping an embassy in Caracas and continuing to have contact with the BCV. These arguments were dismissed by the court, which </span><a href=\\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-53262767\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">stated </span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">that there was \u201cno room for recognition of Mr. Guaid\xf3 as de jure president and of Mr. Maduro as de facto president.\u201d The judge, in other words, deferred to the UK government\u2019s political guidance.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Now, first and foremost, the decision is a </span><a href=\\"https://presidenciave.com/presidencia/comunicado-oficial-ante-la-decision-de-la-alta-corte-de-londres-que-reconoce-al-gobierno-legitimo-del-presidente-e-juan-guaido/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">win</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> for the Venezuelan opposition largely due to the regime\u2019s unadulterated history of corruption and mismanagement. Indeed, the notion that 100% of the gold would have gone to aid the government\u2019s coronavirus response is laughable to most Venezuelans. And even if it was transferred directly from London to UN headquarters in New York, one does not simply show up at the UNDP with a bag full of gold and expect PPE in return.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Nevertheless, the decision doesn\u2019t immediately transfer the gold to the opposition either.

And given that the BoE custodian agreement isn\u2019t with the Venezuelan executive, but with the BCV, the bank and the court would now need to extend their recognition to the ad hoc BCV board named by Guaid\xf3.

However, what would be the likely response by an institution that has already set a precedent for asking too many questions and over-valuing political considerations? Would the BoE have reason to think that the opposition isn\u2019t frugal or financially adept at auditing its members? Would the BoE not consider what self-identified members of the opposition have condoned and supported in the past?\xa0</span></p>\\n<blockquote><p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Until the UK High Court takes up the matter again and decides on whether Guaid\xf3\u2019s camp is the bullion\u2019s legal representative, the current limbo will persist.</span></p></blockquote>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While further exegesis of the law is required, Guaid\xf3\u2019s legal team (which has </span><a href=\\"https://www.dw.com/es/guaid%C3%B3-el-oro-ser%C3%A1-protegido-hasta-la-transici%C3%B3n-en-venezuela/a-54047192\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">signalled</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> that they don\u2019t seek to move the gold anytime soon) has indicated its willingness to consider the precedent set by the ruling and seek to at least freeze other foreign assets across Europe. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The caretaker government\u2019s Ambassador to the UK, Vanessa Neumann, has provided little detail on what specific assets they might target next, but the entire exercise </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">might be a little bit trickier than expected.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In recent years, the Venezuelan government has wound down numerous operations and assets across the continent in a bid to avoid U.S. sanctions, and politics in those specific countries might not be able to bend judicial decisions. Ms. Neumann admitted as much in an </span><a href=\\"https://www.elnuevosiglo.com.co/articulos/06-2020-puja-por-oro-venezolano-hacia-un-fallo-politico-de-quilates\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">interview</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> with El Nuevo Siglo, stating: \u201cA legal ruling has much more weight than a political pronouncement and that should set a precedent for other foreign assets in Europe. That\u2019s what we are thinking. But let&#8217;s see, because between theory and practice (&#8230;) particularly when it comes to politics and money, there are always complications.\u201d\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Setting \u201ccomplications\u201d aside, if the opposition is able to find and target other assets in friendly countries across Europe, further rulings like that of Judge Teare are likely on the pipeline.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Perhaps the single silver lining, for now, is how the BoE has a pretty solid record as a custodian. Past custodians for countries which have seen large financial assets frozen have been more than permeable to corruption. Libya\u2019s wealth fund, for example, was frozen by the UN Security Council following the toppling of Muammar Qaddafi in 2011, but has seen leaks develop ever since, with large amounts of cash going missing in transactions that should have never been cleared by investment banks.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The BoE, i</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">n contrast, holds bullion on a set-aside basis, so a clear record and weight list of each gold bar is likely available to Ms Neumann, and Guaido-backed BCV officials. The BoE also</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> facilitates gold lending in London using the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), to facilitate deposits and swaps. In this case, the original gold bars are taken by banks offering access to the financial instruments, but the banks and the BoE both have a liability to the customer. Hence, it is safe to assume that there won\u2019t be much leakage, or opportunities for corruption will at least be very limited.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">So, until the UK High Court takes up the matter again and decides on whether Guaid\xf3\u2019s camp is the bullion\u2019s legal representative, the current limbo will persist. Another positive ruling for the opposition will, nevertheless, have a significant number of strings attached that might limit Guaid\xf3\u2019s use of the funds. Avenues to change the likely status quo are beyond the scope of this particular article, but unless the opposition shortens the gap between them and the White House</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">,</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> which would take considerable effort following the still beyond-words \u201cOperation Gede\xf3n\u201d, and comes up with a credible excuse to use the funds, that bullion is not going anywhere.</span></p>\\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nicol\xe1s Maduro\u2019s regime is officially barred from accessing the Venezuelan gold stored at the Bank of England.

style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While the COVID-19 pandemic is bound to have profound social and economic repercussions in China\u2014as in every corner of the world\u2014the Chinese Communist Party is fixated on winning hearts and minds around the world. Making use of foreign language official media and the social media accounts of Chinese officials and government entities, Beijing has launched a worldwide campaign to promote its narrative regarding China\u2019s handling of the pandemic. The message has three core components: the Chinese government managed the first outbreak transparently and efficiently, China is leading the effort to help developing nations in dealing with the pandemic, and Western nations have done poorly in containing the spread of the virus. Buttressing the message is an unequivocal comparison between a China success story and a Western failure.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">China\u2019s message is unmistakably targeted at the Global South. In his address at the World Health Assembly on May 18</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">th</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, </span><a href=\\"https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1188716.shtml\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">President Xi Jinping said</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> China will provide US$2 billion to developing countries to help them address the economic and social consequences of the pandemic. In the meantime, the United States is in the process of withdrawing from the World Health Organization.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In the case of Venezuela, the Chinese government had shied away from publicly supporting Maduro\u2014at least compared to how effusive it used to be just a few years back. The last visit of a high-level Chinese diplomat to Venezuela was that of President Xi Jinping in 2014, no new loans have been extended since 2016, and news about the Venezuelan crisis has been largely ignored by Chinese official media. China\u2019s reticence towards Venezuela can be explained by the fact that after USD$65 billion in loans\u2014given the appalling results of their projects in the country\u2014they don\u2019t want to be blamed for the Venezuelan debacle.\xa0</span></p>\\n<blockquote><p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">After all, developing nations far outnumber developed ones, and Venezuela\u2019s vote at the United Nations counts the same as Germany\u2019s.</span></p></blockquote>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">But all that might change in the coming months: many political analysts tend to portray Beijing\u2019s media push within the framework of the growing tensions between China and the West, particularly with the United States. They\u2019re missing the point. China\u2019s donations and outreach efforts are directed at the developing world in the hopes of gaining wider support for its policies internationally. After all, developing nations far outnumber developed ones, and Venezuela\u2019s vote at the United Nations counts the same as Germany\u2019s. The more \u201cfriends\u201d China has globally, the more clout it will have in international forums. The diplomatic bickering between China and the West is just part of the sideshow.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In the context of COVID-19, Venezuela earned a new place in China\u2019s geopolitical considerations. The detention camps for Uighurs in Xinjiang, the National Security Law in Hong Kong, cross-strait relations with Taiwan, and the government\u2019s handling of COVID-19, are all considered national security concerns by the CCP. Given the growing tensions with the West and the intense criticism received because of the aforementioned items, China will seek to strengthen the voices of those countries that support its policies. And that\u2019s where Maduro comes in. Having a vocal supporter in the Americas that defends Chinese policies might carry enough weight for Beijing to extend a new lifeline to Maduro.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A clear manifestation of this was the last session of the United Nations Human Rights Council celebrated in Geneva on June, 30</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">th</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. During the meeting, two statements were read back to back, one promoted by Cuba in support of China&#8217;s passing of the National Security Law for Hong Kong, and the other by the U.K. condemning it. 52 countries sided with Cuba, 26 with the UK, and many abstained from voting. Not one country from Latin America or Africa opposed the statement. Maduro\u2019s representative obviously voted in favor, while the United States </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">brill\xf3 por su ausencia</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> since it withdrew from the body in 2018.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Excluding the nations that hold official relations with Taiwan, every country in Latin America has received some form of medical support from China. Although there\u2019s no comprehensive data on China\u2019s donations to the region, there\u2019s no doubt China\u2019s aid dwarfs that of any other country or international organization. Back in March, the Jack Ma Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the Alibaba group, </span><a href=\\"https://www.alizila.com/factsheet-jack-ma-foundation-alibaba-foundations-coronavirus-donations-and-efforts/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">pledged to donate</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> a total of two million masks, 400,000 test kits and 104 ventilators to 24 Latin American countries. Chinese companies Huawei, ZTE, Didi, China Railway Construction Corporation, among others, have all made sizable donations throughout the region. Venezuela was the first country to receive Chinese medical personnel back in March.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There\u2019s still a long way ahead in the fight against COVID-19, and the jury is still out on whether China\u2019s donations and media push will bear fruit. One thing is clear though, while the United States is marred by its domestic politics during an election year, and most of the Western world is focused on its own handling of the pandemic, China is the only big player reaching out to developing countries. In the post-COVID-19 world, the international order might look quite different, and liberal democracies will not be too happy about it.</span></p>\\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Asian superpower has been building a tight relationship with Venezuela and all of Latin America for years.

Federal sources said to El Tiempo that Boliche gave valuable information about Saab, that could lead to the arrests of eight people involved in approaching authorities for large sums of money.

Two days before Saab was captured, El Tiempo got a hold on Boliche in Miami, but before they asked the first question he hung up.

As the days went on, his stress increased, until suddenly, all the places started to respond. Jos\xe9 went to four interviews, and the four hospitals offered him the job. He started to work as a medical doctor in June 2018.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">During this time, Jos\xe9 got to see how difficult it was to make friends in Germany. While he always was treated with respect, German culture is a lot more reserved. His colleagues wouldn\u2019t consider him a friend for a long time.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">He waited until he felt more comfortable with the medical language and the German medical system to apply for the permanent validation of his degree. He would have to take a comprehensive exam, in which he would be interrogated by a panel of three doctors for an entire day.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In 2019, Jos\xe9 was notified about the date of his test only a month before he had to take it and the place appointed would be M\xfcnster, infamous for having the toughest evaluators, with a very low approval rate.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Jos\xe9 had to review six years of med school in German, and would later remember this as one of the hardest months since he left Venezuela.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The day of the test came and Jos\xe9, along with four other doctors, were interrogated for over ten hours. Jos\xe9\u2019s preparation and his German skills didn\u2019t go unnoticed and he was one of the two who passed. Now, he plans to keep studying Internal Medicine. In the future, he\u2019d like to set up a consult where people from different nationalities feel welcomed, and where he can make use of both his medical knowledge and his language skills. Germany is a very different place from what he had seen in Venezuela. Slowly but surely, he has earned the trust of his colleagues, and he has developed true friendships. He doesn\u2019t know what the future will bring, but he knows that he is in the right place for him, and for whatever may come.</span></p>\\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Leaving your country of origin to look for a new job is quite the task, especially for those who have to learn a new language.

Indeed, this demographer would die on the hill of Cajigal having overestimated the Venezuelan population in 1838. Worse, according to the incensed demographer, Cajigal\u2019s overestimate distorted population counts for the rest of the 19th century. To believe Cajigal and his unwitting acolytes, the demographer argues, is to swallow the improbable conclusion that the Venezuelan population grew faster in the 19th century than in the early 20th century. An unlikely story, he says.</span></p>\\n<blockquote><p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Eulogies</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> for Professor Baptista have </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">extolled</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> his accomplishments as an economist, economic historian, intellectual historian, teacher, colleague, and </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">all-around \u201chigh-level thinker.\u201d</span></p></blockquote>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The demographer proposed a correction. The correction isn\u2019t trivial: without it, Venezuela held close to 2.5 million inhabitants at the turn of the 20th century; with it, a mere 2 million. Those five hundred thousand souls will make a big difference in your study of the evolution of GDP per capita.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">But wait.

The law hasn\u2019t been published in official AN media or shared with the press.

But how much did they really bring in, and how long will it last?</b></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In late May and early June, five Iranian tankers came to Venezuela without much trouble. Allegedly, they carried one and a half million fuel barrels, but the real number is a bit less, since they also brought additives and other by-products, like lubricants. It\u2019s not a big number if we consider the Venezuelan fuel usage, but this has dropped because of the prolonged quarantine and our own economic recession.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">At first, it was estimated that the Iranian fuel would last for about 40 days, but it will go on for longer because the economy is paralyzed and many can\u2019t afford the international price set for it. The government has prioritized Caracas and the rest of the country has to suffer on a larger or smaller scale. Recurring power outages in cities like M\xe9rida and Maracaibo only make matters worse, since you can\u2019t pump fuel without electricity.</span></p>\\n<p>A tanker coming from Trinidad and Tobago came in April, carrying 150,000 barrels of fuel, which surprisingly led the Trinitarian parliament to open an investigation. This shipment helped ease the crisis for a few days. Another somewhat helpful bit is the current use of natural gas for vehicles (GNV), sold in some stations with the old, subsidized price tag. Since 2009, car assembly lines, importing companies, and dealers have to make sure that vehicles come with the GNV system in their engines, whether they use it or not.</p>\\n<p><b>Gas stations are being expropriated now; what does this mean for the fuel distribution business in Venezuela?</b></p>\\n<p>There are 1,680 gas stations in Venezuela on record. Many of them, however, have closed down in the past few years and PDVSA currently owns around 200. According to the Energy and Oil Ministry Resolution N\xb0 013 from March 9<sup>th</sup>, 2009, gas stations are establishments with permits from the aforementioned ministry to retail fuel to end consumers. Retail sellers are commonly known as licensees. The facilities, as well as the storage and pumping equipment in these stations, are property of PDVSA, and the brand is PDVSA\u2019s. The real estate, meaning the plot of land and other assets, could be owned by the licensees. Well, last June, around 40 gas stations received a letter from PDVSA, telling them that their contract was being terminated. As a general rule, the Oil Ministry (not PDVSA) is the one with the authority to revoke permits, since fuel supply is a public service. This, of course, should also include the licensees\u2019 right to receive compensation for the early termination of permits, in response to money spent as investment and forecasted future earnings. This is a very delicate subject and we can\u2019t give a definite opinion, because with all certainty each licensee case is different and many of them could be the subjects of discrimination. If PDVSA is keeping the real estate, it would definitely be an expropriation, or even worse, a confiscation.</p>\\n<p>The concept of an early termination of the license or permit in case of public interest is written in the country\u2019s legislation as a prerogative in the hands of the public administration that carries compensation for the licensee. The debate on whether the law was rightly applied in recent cases is ongoing; however, the early termination is a general principle in administrative law, traditionally recognized by Venezuelan courts.</p>\\n<p><b>Is expropriating gas stations a sign that the regime is rebuilding the country\u2019s ability to produce and distribute fuel? Is there business in foreign currency to be made that the regime doesn\u2019t want to share with the private sector?</b></p>\\n<p>We honestly don\u2019t see that trend. To have access to fuel, you need to import it or refine it locally. The regime has made some efforts on both fronts. But there is the question on whether this is sustainable in the long run. You can\u2019t underestimate its ability to jump over hurdles, even if it means more hardship for the Venezuelan people.</p>\\n<blockquote><p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Selling gasoline today at international prices is good business, although it can become scarce at some point, so we can\u2019t rule out the possibility of stations being operated directly by PDVSA, or reassigned to other dealers who can get permits.</span></p></blockquote>\\n<p>Keep in mind that there\u2019s a restructuring plan for PDVSA, presumably prepared by the regime and exposed by the international press, although it hasn\u2019t been confirmed by an official source, and this plan recommended the gradual decrease of fuel subsidies, as well as the handing out of licenses to private companies to operate refineries.</p>\\n<p>The regime is taking other actions too, like Decree N\xb0 4,200 of May 29<sup>th</sup>, 2020, by which the Valued Added Tax, the Import Tax, and Customs Duties will be exonerated in regards to definitive imports and fuel sales, as well as on supplies and additives carried out by state, joint, and private companies. Nevertheless, according to the current statutes, neither joint companies nor private companies are allowed to import or sell fuel the way this decree indicates. For this to happen, Decree N\xb0 1,648 of January 15<sup>th</sup>, 2002 and the Liquid Fuels Domestic Market Law would have to be modified.</p>\\n<p><b>What can we expect from refineries? Is it true that they\u2019re trying to operate again with Iranian help?</b></p>\\n<p>Lack of official news from the government prevents us from having a clear image of what\u2019s going on in the refineries. It\u2019s true that PDVSA has been trying to recover the Amuay, Card\xf3n, and El Palito refineries with the aid of Chinese, Iranian, and Venezuelan companies. Some reports say that these refineries are producing around 140,000 barrels of gas per day.</p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: 0.001rem;\\">The first obstacle to normal activity is the technology used in these facilities. Most of it came from the U.S., since they were built by Exxon, Shell, and Mobil, with help from American engineering companies. You would also need highly qualified management and technical teams, together with expensive maintenance plans so the operation continues successfully over time.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: 0.001rem;\\">Then there\u2019s the downwards trend in Venezuelan oil production. Chances are that the government will need to sell all of that oil abroad in order to obtain foreign currency, or to pay debts to key creditors.</span></p>\\n<p><b>Can we assume that, from now on, fuel will be paid in dollars at gas stations?</b></p>\\n<p>We believe so. In any case, you can still pay in bolivars at the official exchange rate given by the Central Bank. Many establishments have points of sale and, despite the economic sanctions that Venezuela has on its shoulders, the U.S. dollar has become a common form of payment in supermarkets, bakeries, pharmacies, hardware stores, and now in non-subsidized gas stations. Venezuelans receive remittances, dollar payments for services or sales, or they\u2019re using up their savings in foreign currency. You also have cases in which people use credit cards and are taking up debt in dollars.</p>\\n<blockquote><p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This system encourages, no doubt, the black market within the country and smuggling into neighboring countries. These methods won\u2019t disappear, but uncertainty is the norm.</span></p></blockquote>\\n<p>Since the bolivar has lost all its value and the law allows for payments in foreign currency, we believe that the dollar will still be the preferred currency for Venezuelans. This could become a problem if the U.S. imposes new sanctions, forbidding the use of electronic payment services in dollars through the Venezuelan financial system, for example. But, the U.S. can\u2019t prevent the use of its currency in Venezuela entirely.</p>\\n<p><b>Are there still incentives for smuggling? Will we continue to depend on fuel sold in the black market?</b></p>\\n<p>Right now there\u2019s a twofold pricing system that has been going on for barely a month. 1,360 gas stations supply subsidized fuel through a system controlled by the last number on license plates. This system encourages, no doubt, the black market within the country and smuggling into neighboring countries. These methods won\u2019t disappear, but uncertainty is the norm.</p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: 0.001rem;\\">Fuel smuggling into neighboring countries did stop during March, April and May, because fuel was only available inside Venezuela at black market (exploitative) prices. Today, 120 liters of fuel per car and 60 per motorcycle, each month, at a ridiculously low price of BsS. 5,000 per liter, provides a great opportunity for smugglers and resellers. Public transport and freight vehicles are completely subsidized for at least 90 days. The price difference with the international price of $0.5 is huge.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: 0.001rem;\\">By the way, we still haven\u2019t seen the new fuel prices in the Official Gazette, as it should be done according to the Hydrocarbons Law.</span></p>\\n<p><b>How close are we to the extinction of lines at gas stations?</b></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Not close at all.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p>Right now, there\u2019s no hint of lines ending outside the capital any time soon, and since we haven\u2019t received any more fuel imports, the country could go through another severe shortage in the short term. Some gas stations outside Caracas aren\u2019t getting fuel anymore and those who live in other states have to endure the long lines, especially for subsidized fuel during restricted schedules, and in an environment where there\u2019s an alarming rise in COVID-19 cases. A close look has to be put on a new development since the Venezuelan government is now trying to import more than 1.1 million barrels of Iranian fuel, apparently in route, while the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, issued a warrant last week for its seizure following a complaint by the U.S. government.</p>\\n<p>In our opinion, the oil industry\u2019s administration model is exhausted. Venezuela should sanction a new oil legislation that allows far-reaching private investment. The bitter confrontation between the regime, the U.S. and the EU, as well as the upcoming parliament elections, are not helping in the resolution of this situation at all.</p>\\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s been over a month since the Iranian fuel tankers brought gasoline to our country.

The agency didn\u2019t provide any specific reasons for the measure.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The new guidelines affect students who are in the U.S. under temporary student visas. They can be either in an academic program like a bachelor\u2019s degree or language training (under an F-1 visa) or in a nonacademic, vocational program (under an M-1 visa). This means more than 1 million students, according to data from the 2018-2019 school year in the </span><a href=\\"https://www.iie.org/en/Research-and-Insights/Open-Doors/Data/International-Students/Enrollment\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Institute of International Education</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. That number includes about seven thousand Venezuelans.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The changes come as COVID-19 cases in the U.S. surpass 3 million and institutions </span><a href=\\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2020/06/22/coronavirus-reopening-college-fall-2020/3210719001/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">plan the modality</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> of their fall semester. Some had begun to roll out their reopening plans, which included a combination of online and in-person classes. Others considered moving to a fully online course load and now face pressure to offer in-person courses so international students can stay in the country.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Regular visa limitations prevent international students from taking classes exclusively online. The agency made exemptions at the beginning of the pandemic lockdowns but only for the spring and summer semesters. Now, if schools remain online, students would technically have two options: return to their home countries and take classes online there, or transfer to an institution that offers a hybrid or completely in-person semester. In practice, however, many countries are still offering a limited number of flights and seeing a rise in the coronavirus cases. Flights from the U.S. are even banned from entering the European Union at the moment.\xa0</span></p>\\n<blockquote><p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Venezuelan students have extra roadblocks. There are few to no flights to Venezuela.</span></p></blockquote>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Venezuelan students have extra roadblocks. There are few to no flights to Venezuela, returning migrants face quarantine imposed by the regime, and the country\u2019s crisis would force them to study with slow internet, lack of sanitary precautions, and economic instability.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">To Elvira Blanco, the news added more uncertainty and anxiety to that already caused by the pandemic. She\u2019s 29 years old and working on a doctorate in Latin American studies in Columbia University, a private school in New York. As of July 8th, the university hadn\u2019t announced how they\u2019d be working in the fall but said it was working to accommodate its international students.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Elvira is at a point in her academic program where she only has to teach, not take classes. She had considered going to Spain with her family and teaching from there if the semester was set to be online. But that plan isn\u2019t easy to achieve amid the pandemic and ICE\u2019s announcement added the pressure of potential deportation. She\u2019s also scared that if she\u2019s deported, she could lose her visa. Her doctorate is her source of income, and losing it could mean losing her scholarship and financial stability, but having the university open completely would mean putting students back in classrooms, and asking the international students who left when lockdowns started to come back from their home countries, increasing the risk of infections. Even with a hybrid model, she has to teach in person, and she fears the only result is that she\u2019ll contract the virus.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">She considered returning to Venezuela when the pandemic started, but with a collapsed healthcare system and the increasing number of cases (only reported by the regime), she decided to stay. Returning now is one of her last options.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Daniel Nu\xf1ez, 21, is in a similar situation. He\u2019s preparing to start a Master\u2019s degree in biomedical engineering at the University of Florida in August, after getting his bachelor\u2019s in materials engineering this spring. UF, a public university, announced on Wednesday that it would make sure its reopening plan includes enough classes for international students to comply with the ICE guidelines.\xa0</span></p>\\n<blockquote><p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Even though his family is still there and \u201cit will always be an option,\u201d he views returning as going back to what he tried to escape by migrating in the first place.</span></p></blockquote>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The university\u2019s announcement brought Daniel a wave of calm. He had envisioned three scenarios for his fall semester. If UF only had online classes, he could apply for an Optional Practical Training (OPT), an employment permission that would allow him to work for a few months, and find a job (in regular circumstances, international students can only work through work-study or an internship program). If UF provided enough in-person classes for him to remain in the country, he would take them and stay. If those two didn\u2019t happen, he could travel to Spain or Argentina where friends could take him in for a few months.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Returning to Venezuela isn&#8217;t a plan.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Even though his family is still there and \u201cit will always be an option,\u201d he views returning as going back to what he tried to escape by migrating in the first place, four years ago. He could go for a few months while the pandemic dies down, but he&#8217;d rather go to a country where he has more opportunities to study and work.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Oriana Mejias is also weighing her options. She&#8217;s working on a doctorate in Latin American culture in the City University of New York. Like UF, CUNY is public so it depends on the decisions of the federal and state governments, and Oriana must wait for New York officials and the university to decide the modality of the fall semester. If the semester is online, her options are also limited. Her passport has expired and her only way to stay out of the U.S. is going to Santiago, Chile, where she had lived before and started an immigration process.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Even if institutions provide enough in-person courses for students to stay, ICE\u2019s announcement also said that, if schools start the semester with in-person classes but are later forced to move online, the students won\u2019t be allowed to take more than one online course and will have to leave the country\u2014or seek alternatives to stay as nonimmigrant students.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">On July 8th, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology </span><a href=\\"https://www.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/content/sevp_filing.pdf\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">sued</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> the Department of Homeland Security and ICE. The schools argue that ICE didn\u2019t give institutions enough warning or time to adjust to the guidelines and, hence, violated a federal statute.

Since access to actual figures of our crisis is the gateway towards national progress, and in the face of a silent state that harasses and persecutes the independent media, the Venezuelan academia took it upon itself to discover just what are the actual seeds of economic disparity in the nation, and what are the main challenges of making a living in our very hostile reality.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The result of that brainstorm is the </span><a href=\\"https://www.proyectoencovi.com/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">ENCOVI project</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. Starting in 2014, with Venezuela already well into social conflict, ENCOVI, which in Spanish stands for \u201cNational Poll on Life Conditions of the Venezuelan Population,\u201d is an effort by three Venezuelan universities (Universidad Cat\xf3lica Andr\xe9s Bello, Universidad Central de Venezuela, and Universidad Sim\xf3n Bol\xedvar) focusing on poverty, the effectivity of social programs (or \u201cmissions,\u201d as they\u2019re called by chavismo), the particular characteristics of Venezuelan households, physical and mental health of the people, mortality and birth rates, the state of maternity health and childhood vaccination programs, emigration, education, nutrition, safety at work and on the streets, the employment rate and the conditions of public services and housing across the nation. The 2020 edition of the report, however, is only signed by Universidad Cat\xf3lica Andr\xe9s Bello.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The general deterioration of our crisis is evident and at the forefront of the 2019-2020 study, when many of the issues attacking Venezuelans degenerated into a humanitarian crisis. After research conducted from November 2019 to March 2020, the ENCOVI team (coordinated by Anita Freitez, a very experienced scholar in the area of demographic studies) polled 9,932 Venezuelan households (the initial goal, curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic, was of 16,920), taking advantage of technology in the reach of its questionnaire.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This is, basically, an independent actor doing a job that the government should be doing and sharing.</span></p>\\n<h2><b>A Deep Demographic Change</b></h2>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Venezuela is part of that club of countries of the former Soviet sphere or Africa which see their populations shrinking because of migration. We are 28.4 million people because about 5 million of us are abroad; by 2011, the year of the last national census, we had surpassed the barrier of 30 million people. But the decrease is also affected by the increase in mortality rate and the fall of the birth rate.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Migration made us not only fewer but older: the exodus of young people pushed the proportion of 60 years old and older from 10% in 2015 to 12% in 2020. We have more senior citizens, more fragile in terms of health and productivity; our society is, therefore, less able to produce wealth and more in need of different ways of assistance.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">And there\u2019s this thing about our </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">demographic bonus</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, that window of opportunity in the life of a nation when it has the best combination of ages to launch a collective jump into development. After decades of having plenty of children and teens in the second half of the 20th century, we were entering this window in 2000, and it looked as if it would last 40 years. ENCOVI shows the demographic change killed our demographic bonus; it ended in 2015. The measures by the chavista regime forced so many young people to emigrate that the good balance among ages we had before the humanitarian emergency started.\xa0</span></p>\\n<blockquote><p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Migration made us not only fewer but older.</span></p></blockquote>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The Venezuelan society after 20 years of chavismo looks like this: those who were born between 2015 and 2020 will live 3.7 years less than was previously predicted by the state; the child mortality rate is at 1980s levels, 26 per 1,000; more than 500,000 households live in </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">ranchos</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, with at least three people per room (when they have rooms at all). Just 1 out of 4 homes has running water every day. Just 1 out of 10 homes has power every day.\xa0\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">We are a smaller, poorer society with a falling purchasing power that limits the market for almost everything, and our social fabric is unraveling, with more and more households depending on one person, more commonly an older woman.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Enter the combination of pandemic-related confinement measures and fuel shortage: unemployment rose 6.9% due to this, and 43% of households polled by ENCOVI report loss of income of employment since March.\xa0</span></p>\\n<h2><b>Straight to the Last Place in the Region\xa0</b></h2>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The ENCOVI survey\u2014which was carried out before the pandemic hit\u2014shows that 79.3% of Venezuelan families can\u2019t afford the basic food basket (50 food products) and 96.2% can\u2019t afford the basic basket (the basic food basket plus 312 other basic needs and services). The number of Venezuelan families that simply can\u2019t afford a basic living standard has been going up since 2012, two years before Venezuela entered a recession and way before the </span><a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Venezuelan_crisis#:&shy;:text=On%2028%20January%2C%20the%20United,the%202019%20Venezuelan%20presidential%20crisis.\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">economic sanctions</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> came into play.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">But being poor doesn\u2019t only mean that you and your family don&#8217;t have enough money for food, but also that your living conditions are way below standard. This is the reality of 6 out of every 10 Venezuelan families. This number has also been going up since, at least, 2014 and places Venezuela as the poorest country in Latin America and the Caribbean.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This doesn\u2019t quite shock us. Not because the government wants Venezuelans to be poor, but wants them to </span><a href=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/2018/01/12/limits-chavismos-strategy/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">depend on the state</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. And, for that, it helps if they\u2019re poor. But now that shortages of basic goods have met hyperinflation and PDVSA has collapsed, the government can\u2019t provide for everyone anymore. Still, to date, ENCOVI shows that as of 2019 public non-wage transfers represent 25.3% of total family income and that 92% of households were part of the CLAP program and received a box at some point.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">To break the cycle of poverty, Venezuelan households need to have the means to support themselves through </span><a href=\\"https://www.oecd.org/statistics/job-quality.htm\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">high-quality jobs</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, meaning relatively well-paid formal jobs in good working environments. However, as ENCOVI shows, members of poor families have less than favorable conditions to compete for a high-quality job. The average age of the heads of households is between 46 and 54 years old and, at most, 4 out of every 10 have a high school or higher education diploma.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Though it\u2019s true that ENCOVI shows that the economically active population has remained unchanged, it\u2019s\u2014to date\u2014the lowest in the region. Also, close to half (45%) of the economically active Venezuelans work on their own (a number that came to 31% in 2014), mostly in retail. Hence, they lack all the benefits of a formally employed worker (such as food vouchers and labor benefits). And when the worker is forced to stop working due to health issues or an unexpected pandemic, the worker and his or her family (of between 2 and 4 members) is left without an income to fall back on.</span></p>\\n<h2><b>The Extent of Food (In)Security</b></h2>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This year, the ENCOVI analysis of the situation of food insecurity in Venezuela includes two new sections: the effects of the pandemic, and the consumption of flour, rice, eggs, and beef according to economic class. The poll analyzes food insecurity through a conceptual basis (worrying to maintain food supply, adjusting budgets and limiting the quality and quantity of food portions at home) and through access to food,\xa0 anthropometric measurements of children under 5 years old, malnutrition by gender and economic class, and data comparisons with the region.</span></p>\\n<blockquote><p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The report also shows that access to food isn\u2019t necessarily linked to income.</span></p></blockquote>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Overall, the poll shows higher levels of food insecurity at homes compared to the ENCOVI 2018 analysis: 79% of homes report lack of a healthy diet (which reaches 83% during the pandemic, compared to the 69% reported during 2018); 49% of adults report not always eating when hungry (compared to 43% in 2018) and 34% of adults report eating only once a day or spending whole days without eating (compared to the 30% in 2018). Currently, 87% of adults are worried food will run out at homes (compared to 84% in 2018) and 57% report effectively running out of food (compared to 54% in 2018). During the pandemic, only 7% of homes haven\u2019t worried about food supply.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It\u2019s important to highlight the comparison between the 2018 poll and the data provided by the 2019-2020 analysis to understand the growth of food insecurity throughout the country. In 2018, it showed 25% of low food insecurity, 31% of moderate food insecurity, and 32% of severe food insecurity. In 2019-2020 the data shows a significant rise in moderate food insecurity, reaching 36%, and severe food insecurity, reaching 33%. In short: 3 out of every 4 households (69%) report moderate and severe food insecurity since 2019.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The survey\u2019s new indicator, which analyzes the food groups eaten according to economic class (and shows the access to flour, rice, eggs, and beef), shows abysmal differences in the consumption of protein between high and lower economic classes. Venezuelans with high income eat 5 times more meat than those with lower income, and 3 times more eggs; highlighting that inequality shows 30% of nutritional differences depending on social status. Lower-income families have carbohydrate-based diets, which results in the national average consumption of protein of only 34.3% of the required level.\xa0\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">But regardless of economic status, the report also shows that access to food isn\u2019t necessarily linked to income, as it also shows the general population\u2019s consumption of food, showing that those with the highest rates are barely above the 2,000-calorie standard. This shows that an equitative distribution of food would barely fulfill the baseline of 2,000 calories per person per day, which highlights a generalized and structural growth of poverty and food access across the country.\xa0\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The nutritional state of children under 5 years old also shows some concerning results, especially when compared to the region. 166,000 children qualify as malnourished, per their weight indicator according to their age. Venezuela\u2019s data shows a closer comparison to countries from Central America than to the South American region. Venezuela\u2019s 8% of child malnourishment worsens the region\u2019s reported average data. But the most worrisome data shown in the poll highlights the 639,000 children who suffer from chronic malnutrition, 30.3% that shows a significant difference between Chile\u2019s 1.8% in 2014, Colombia\u2019s 12.7% in 2016, and Peru\u2019s 13.1% in 2016.\xa0</span></p>\\n<h2><b>Migration: Draining the Country of Human Resources\xa0</b></h2>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">ENCOVI shows that 19% of Venezuelan households reported that at least one of their members left the country between 2014 and 2019. This is in line with an increase in the number of households that report having members abroad, and in the number of family members within a household who have emigrated. The survey also shows an increased gender gap. Women comprised the majority of migrants up until 2015. The last five years have reversed those percentages to the point where men were the majority in the 2017 ENCOVI survey. The 2019-2020 survey shows 54% of migrants are men.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In terms of age, this year\u2019s survey shows a drop in Venezuelan migrants between the ages of 15-29. With 49% they remain the largest group of migrants, but this is a 9% drop from 2018. Instead, migrants ages 30-49 increased from 2018 to 2019.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The majority of Venezuelan migrants continue to leave seeking jobs or having one secured, but the percentage increased from 67% in 2017 to 82.8% in 2019-2020. Also, the second most common reason for leaving in 2017 was \u201cother\u201d. In 2019-2020, it was \u201cfamily reunification\u201d. In addition, 30% of households with members abroad reported receiving remittances\u2014especially those led by women facing poverty. In 2019, more Venezuelans 60 and older were the ones receiving remittances.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">According to the report, before the pandemic, 4% of recent migrants considered returning. The number can be higher now, but ENCOVI expects emigration will slow down yet not stop after the pandemic, given that the majority goes abroad because they can\u2019t find jobs in the country.</span></p>\\n<h2><b>Education, a Shadow of What It Was</b></h2>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">ENCOVI estimates that 1.7 million people in the 3 to 24-year-old demographic have left the country, which reduces pressure on the demand for education. The attendance rate in young adults aged 18 to 24 dropped to 25%, compared to 47% in 2014. In teens between 12 to 17, the attendance rate is 85%. The attendance rate in the 18-24 demographic has been steadily declining since 2016.\xa0</span></p>\\n<blockquote><p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Around half of the more vulnerable population can\u2019t complete 12 years of school or graduate, which would help in some way to reduce the risks of remaining in poverty.</span></p></blockquote>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In addition, education coverage has dropped by half from that year: it was 48% in 2018. ENCOVI estimates that there are 3,136,000 people between 18 to 24 years old still residing in the country, out of which only 775,000 are attending school, versus 2,282,000 who don\u2019t.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Out of 7.8 million children in the country, from 3 to 17 years old, 40% report difficulties to attend school, for problems with water supply (23%), blackouts (17%), no food at home (16%), lack of transport (7%), or lack of teachers (18%).\xa0\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In conclusion, around half of the more vulnerable population can\u2019t complete 12 years of school or graduate, which would help in some way to reduce the risks of remaining in poverty. There\u2019s a huge step back in education for the population between 18 to 24 years old, the COVID-19 lockdown will deepen inequalities and those who don\u2019t have access to new technologies or lack the appropriate conditions for learning at home will be hit the hardest.\xa0</span></p>\\n<h2><b>The Harder Questions</b></h2>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The diagnostic shown by the ENCOVI survey is, of course, a discouraging addition to what we\u2019ve been able to learn about the country through academic studies and journalism regarding the state of political institutions and the economy\u2014there\u2019s no single number issued by the government that can be relied upon.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The large scale collapse of\xa0 Venezuela provides a somber reality today, but an even more chilling picture of the future. Chavismo destroyed the economy, our internal capacity to produce food and basic services, it ravaged the oil industry to the point that we can\u2019t even produce our own gasoline and its parts are being given away to international partners for favors that only worsen the current situation. But what will that look like in the future? This is the question that has to be in the center of our minds when analyzing the ENCOVI results.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Does the world realize the urgency of what\u2019s going on in Venezuela and what it can become? High levels of malnutrition, low levels of education, rising infant deaths, migration of citizens who are approaching their most productive years, aging of the local population, limited access to food and health services.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The diagnosis is clear, our country is dying. We also know the cause. But the bigger question here is: will we be able to find a cure in time?</span></p>\\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our main universities released the latest ENCOVI survey and the figures are as bad as we imagined.

beyond South American standards, more similar to African standards,\u201d said on Tuesday morning Luis Pedro Espa\xf1a when he presented results of the Living Conditions National Survey. Everything is alarming: 96% of the country lives in income poverty and 68% lives in consumption poverty, a consequence of having lost 70% of our GDP in the last six years. We\u2019re a very poor country that has resisted two years of hyperinflation. ENCOVI doesn\u2019t only measure income, it cross-checked data on the quality of housing, utilities, overcrowding, job quality and school assistance. So, multidimensional poverty grew 14% in a year, and went from 51% in 2018 to 64.8% in 2019; 44% of the population stayed in economic inactivity, the amount of workers in the public and private sector has decreased and the number of people generating income on their own has grown. In education: 1.7 million children stopped going to school, almost 4 million children are in a vulnerable situation and their right to education isn\u2019t guaranteed. 60% of the student population manages to attend school and over half of the poorer population doesn\u2019t finish high school.\xa0</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">We\u2019re the second most unequal country in Latin America, with the highest malnutrition level,\xa0 30% of children under five years old, a figure that can be compared to Nigeria\u2019s. This is due to the fact that only 3% of Venezuelan homes are safe and don\u2019t have any kind of food insecurity, 70% of homes have a serious or moderate food insecurity, and the average protein intake is merely 34.3% of the recommended intake, and the poorer strata have a carb-based nutrition. The difference in protein intake between the poorest stratum and the richest, is five times more. The life expectancy rate decreased 3.7 years for children born between 2015 and 2020, and the child mortality rate increased to 26 per 1,000 inhabitants. These are serious numbers, and once more, ENCOVI warned about the long term consequences.\xa0</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Nicol\xe1s\u2019s Communications minister, Jorge Rodr\xedguez, reported that there are 282 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 7,693 cases they\u2019ve admitted to.

On the other hand, Russian oil exports for the U.S. increased 78.6% in the first quarter, and in a year, it became the third supplier of oil and fuels in the American market, only topped by Canada and Mexico, a position they reached because of Venezuela\u2019s disappearance.\xa0</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The PSOE allied with Podemos on Wednesday and stopped the Spanish Congress from expressing their rejection of EU ambassador Isabel Brilhante Pedrosa being expelled from Venezuela.

Their red color blazed against the fire and when you opened them up, the aroma of sweet chili peppers would serve as a preview of the savory pleasure.

Fishermen have to pay a high price to work with fishnets, lines, and hooks. They depend on the black market to get fuel and engine oil. The drop in locals\u2019 purchasing power, plus the chance of selling fish in dollars offshore, have caused fishermen to sell their best fish to whoever has dollars. So most </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">margarite\xf1os</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> have to settle for not-so-appetizing fish that get caught in the nets.</span></p>\\n<h2><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The Dollar Decides</span></h2>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\u201cFishing falls under the laws of supply and demand, even for humble fishermen,\u201d says Walter Gonz\xe1lez, professor at the </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Escuela de Ciencias Aplicadas del Mar (School for Applied Sea Sciences)</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> in the Marine Biology program of the Universidad de Oriente. The variation in the availability of marine species for consumption, he says, is caused by how they\u2019re marketed offshore: \u201cSome species are very sought after, like the red snapper, the grouper, or even the mackerel, that are now rarely served in Margarita because they\u2019re taken to other islands; they\u2019re more valuable in Trinidad and Tobago, for example. There\u2019s a high variety of edible fish here, like blue fishes: tuna, pompano, mackerel, sawfish, sardines. But those with a high commercial value, don\u2019t even reach our docks.\u201d</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The researcher also claims that high load capacity boats anchor by the islands of Los Testigos and Los Frailes, waiting for fishermen from Margarita and Sucre who head over there to offer their products, which are then sold abroad.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Fishing production has certainly continued in Margarita, it\u2019s just that for the regular </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">margarite\xf1o,</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> the fish that they were used to eating has become harder to purchase, because of their availability and price. People are inclined to buy sardines or skates, while red snapper or groupers are way beyond their means. That means that the balance of supply and demand is off, according to Gonz\xe1lez.</span></p>\\n<figure id=\\"attachment_80949\\" class=\\"wp-caption alignnone\\" style=\\"max-width: 2570px;\\" itemprop=\\"image\\" itemscope itemtype=\\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\\"><a href=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/20171210-110314.jpg\\" data-fancybox=\\"image\\"><img data-attachment-id=\\"80949\\" data-permalink=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/2020/07/02/no-more-fancy-fish-in-margarita/20171210-110314/\\" data-orig-file=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/20171210-110314.jpg\\" data-orig-size=\\"2560,1920\\" data-comments-opened=\\"0\\" data-image-meta=\\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.6&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;GT-I8190L&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1512903793&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;3.54&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.016666&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\\" data-image-title=\\"20171210-110314\\" data-image-description=\\"\\" data-medium-file=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/20171210-110314-300x225.jpg\\" data-large-file=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/20171210-110314-1024x768.jpg\\" class=\\"wp-image-80949 size-full\\" src=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/20171210-110314.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"2560\\" height=\\"1920\\" srcset=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/20171210-110314.jpg 2560w, https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/20171210-110314-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/20171210-110314-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/20171210-110314-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/20171210-110314-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/20171210-110314-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\\" /></a><figcaption itemprop=\\"caption\\"><h6>Even at ports where the fishermen dock, what\u2019s available goes to a preferential market that values the fish at a higher price than what regular folk can afford.

He goes every week to El Tirano, once one of the most important ports in the island, to buy fish or to trade it for flour, rice, or pasta. \u201cYou don\u2019t see the fishermen boats like before, filled to the brim with red snapper, mackerel, sawfish, </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">cuna</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> grouper, barracudas or </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">medregal </span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">tuna,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to buy a kilo of good fish at the beach if you only have bolivars. The refrigerated trucks and the cold rooms near the beach are first in line for purchase, because they\u2019re the ones providing fishermen with engine oil and fuel.\u201d</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\u201cWhat you\u2019ll find is second rate fish, what the regular </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">margarite\xf1o</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> buys, in bolivars or bartering: yellowhead jawfish, white grunt, megrim, crevalle jack, yellow jack, </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">guatacara</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">cataco</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, whitespotted filefish, </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">cachama</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">guaquinillo</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">arar\xe1</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> white grunt. In the Los Frailes islands, you\u2019ll see a different scenario, where high-end boats spend the night and then buy the best fish to take to the smaller islands: Trinidad, Martinique, St. Lucia, Guadalupe, St. Vincent. All paid in dollars.\u201d</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\u201cAt other important ports, like Manzanillo, fishing is done with nets, so the yellow jack, pompano, </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">carachana pintada</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, catfish, white grunt, and sardine are common. We\u2019re talking about a catch of between 20 to 70 tonnes per casting. The same thing happens there, the best fish are sold outside of the island, while the owners of the fishing trains and machinery give the residents some of what they catch; that noble gesture, as we call it here, has helped us against hunger for the last five years.\u201d</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Mar\xeda Tineo is a teacher and member of a fishing family. She says that traditional fishing has become a threat, as it was during the bottom-trawling fishing period, because boats and refrigerated trucks get all the fish, including the small ones that haven\u2019t finished growing, endangering the reproduction for these species.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Fishermen have another threat to deal with: crime. Those spending the night in Los Frailes run the risk to save fuel, because their engines and even their food can be stolen. Many fishermen who have been robbed leave the trade or quit to try their luck into the high seas, where the best fish can be caught.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Lesly Indriago is a young fisherwoman. She started when she was 14 years old, quitting school for a job that provides enough income. She used to spend the night in Los Frailes, along with her partner and small children. Last month, a group of armed masked men raided her family\u2019s quarters, stole four engines, and their food supply. \u201cMy kids were screaming non-stop. We can\u2019t stay there anymore.\u201d But Lesly has another problem: she has no boat or engine, so she was taken off the list of those allowed to buy fuel. \u201cI can borrow from someone, but what\u2019s the point if I don\u2019t have fuel? Plus, there\u2019s also the risk of my fishing train (a large fishing net) getting stolen, because that beach gets very lonely.\u201d</span></p>\\n<blockquote><p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Fishermen have another threat to deal with: crime. </span></p></blockquote>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">On July 1</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">st</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, the octopus season began, even though some fishermen were already fishing them, taking the risk of confiscation by the National Guard. Merchants are selling it for $2.10 per kilo. Once the legal season begins, the battle to settle on a price by the truck owners begins. Octopus is sold by the sack to the cold rooms which store and pile it up until the season is closed, and then sell it at a better price. Fishermen will give away a few to those helping pull the boat to shore, then they sell it to small merchants and the product becomes available before the truck owners monopolize it.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Octopus season is a period of relative prosperity because it brings a lot of people to the beach, and neighbors go and sell cakes, desserts, bracelets or necklaces.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you aren\u2019t lucky enough to buy good fish at the ports, you can go to the Los Cocos Market, in Porlamar. You\u2019ll find everything, because that\u2019s where the truck owners trade.</span></p>\\n<h2><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Clams and Mussels Are Getting Scarce</span></h2>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">tripa \u2018e perla </span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">clam that used to be sold by women door to door at very low prices, is now very rare.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The banks where several bivalve species live are located between the island of Cubagua and Punta de Piedras: there, the </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">pata \u2018e cabra</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> clam, </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">tripa \u2018e perla</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> clam, West Indian fighting conch, Mother of Pearl, mussels and other species are extracted. They\u2019re taken to Punta de Piedras where the largest group of shellers (who boil and open the shells) are found.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Pedro Garc\xeda states that this is caused by two reasons;\xa0 first, the mollusc banks are running out due to over-exploitation, since more fishermen see them as a way to make a living, with their high demand; second, there\u2019s a low supply of engine oil, fuel, and parts for outboard motorboats. These hurdles steer the fisherman towards large head hairtails, for example, which are pricier, or macro algae, sought after by Koreans, which are exported from the island.</span></p>\\n<blockquote><p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">We\u2019re talking about a catch of between 20 to 70 tonnes per casting. The same thing happens there, the best fish are sold outside of the island.</span></p></blockquote>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Walter Gonz\xe1lez adds that the traditional way of extracting clams and other molluscs, called raking, is very aggressive and it can destroy their natural banks.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Even at ports where the boats dock, what\u2019s available goes to a preferential market that values them at a much higher price than what regular folk can afford. In Manzanillo, where mussels are extracted, a favored snack at parties and events, you used to get them by the sack between July and August. This species, which isn\u2019t very common in its natural habitat, has also decreased its number because of human predators and its price. You can run into the scuba divers near noon, arriving with half a sack or less, offering them for $4 a kilo already shelled, or $1.50 closed. Having a plate of mussel soup with margarite\xf1o chili peppers is almost a memory now.</span></p>\\n<h2><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The Largehead Hairtail Case</span></h2>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In 2017, the Fishing and Aquaculture Ministry (</span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Ministerio del Poder Popular de Pesca y Acuicultura)</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> limited the permits given to export largehead hairtail, to bring down prices and protect the hydro biological resources from over-exploitation.\xa0 High demand for this species, that used to be handed out to those who helped pull the fishing train, made its price go up even above the mackerel\u2019s.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">According to Professor Walter Gonz\xe1lez, Chinese factories in Margarita fix the price in dollars and then export it.

Be it the economy, conflict abroad, or migration policies, candidates tend to emphasize one issue\u2014tested for hundreds of hours on focus groups\u2014and then they repeat it again, and again, and then some more.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This election season, we\u2019re likely going to hear a lot about Venezuela. The reason: Latino voters.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Electoral arguments are rarely built without having a specific demographic in mind, the larger the better. This year, Latinos are expected for the first time to be the largest ethnic minority in the U.S., with around 32 million Latinos expected to be eligible to vote. That number is compounded by the fact that two-in-three Latino voters </span><a href=\\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/03/most-of-the-23-million-immigrants-eligible-to-vote-in-2020-election-live-in-just-five-states/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">live</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> in just five states: California, New York, Texas, Arizona, and Florida. The latter three will be in contention in November 2020.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Eligible Latino voters have for the most part sided with the Democratic Party in recent years, but they\u2019re hardly a predictable voting bloc. The 2016 elections served to debunk several widely held beliefs echoed by most American pollsters, the majority of which suggested that Trump\u2019s hawkish immigration rhetoric would eventually push even conservative-leaning Hispanics to vote against the Republican candidate. Left-leaning Hispanics, moreover, would be mobilized to vote in droves in support of the Democratic front-runner, regardless of their policy priorities. This didn\u2019t happen.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A surge in Latino voters didn\u2019t </span><a href=\\"https://www.npr.org/2016/12/22/506347254/latinos-will-never-vote-for-a-republican-and-other-myths-about-hispanics-from-20\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">materialize</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, and the overall numbers of Hispanics who voted for the Democratic Party fell by 5% from 2012 to 2016. How many Hispanics voted for Trump is a debated issue, estimates ranging from 28% to 18%, but that\u2019s still a sizable number considering that Trump doesn\u2019t need to win the entire </span><a href=\\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/02/24/2020-hispanic-voters-donald-trump-225192\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">vote </span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">to come out with a successful outcome in most states; he just needs to move the needle.\xa0</span></p>\\n<blockquote><p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The team around Trump does understand the damage the U.S. president will do to his re-election chances if he appears weak on Venezuela, and loses voters in South Florida.\xa0</span></p></blockquote>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Setting aside the myriad of explanations why Latinos didn\u2019t immediately rush to the Democratic camp\u2014ranging from economic arguments (increased economic competition) to syncretic values (abortion)\u2014there\u2019s little evidence to suggest we might not see a repeat of 2016, and that Republicans can\u2019t </span><a href=\\"https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/fact-sheet/latinos-in-the-2016-election-florida/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">attract </span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">a sizeable number of Hispanic voters. And one specific sub-section of the voting bloc is likely to be in the sights of Republican pollsters: first and second-generation Cubans residing in South Florida.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Two-thirds of the U.S.\u2019 1.2 million eligible Cuban voters live in Florida, </span><a href=\\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/15/unlike-other-latinos-about-half-of-cuban-voters-in-florida-backed-trump/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">representing </span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">around 31% of all Latino voters. This particular voting bloc is also heavily skewed to the right, and still holds a grudge towards an Obama administration that sought to normalize relations with the communist government in Havana and failed to pressure Caracas during its transition between Hugo Ch\xe1vez and Nicol\xe1s Maduro. Indeed, around 54% of Cubans voted for Trump the first time around, according to the Pew Research Center.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Among first and second-generation Cuban migrants in Florida, there are several widely held beliefs, including the notion that the communist regime in Havana continues to exist in large part because of Caracas, and the support Venezuela has granted not only to the Castros but to every left-leaning government across the continent. Indeed, at its height, trade with Venezuela </span><a href=\\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/27/cuba-venezuela-castro-maduro-socialist-economics-reform\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">accounted</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> for around 20% of Cuba\u2019s GDP, and Venezuela\u2019s economic downfall has also catalyzed the return of bread lines across Cuba.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Trump\u2019s re-election campaign doesn\u2019t need to elaborate on this argument or list them out in a comprehensive manner. Come November, it just needs to continue to deliver the message it has delivered for much of the past three years: \u201cWe are tough on Venezuela.\u201d\xa0</span></p>\\n<h2><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">What \u2018Tough on Venezuela\u2019 Really Means</span></h2>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This message, one would think, is pretty easy to deliver and there is tangible evidence to suggest that Trump is in fact, in favor of Venezuelan democracy. Ironically\u2014or what others inside the beltway would describe as predictably\u2014Trump doesn\u2019t help himself when speaking out of turn. In late June, we saw the U.S. president saying loud and clear to an Axios reporter that he would be open to meeting with Nicol\xe1s Maduro, adding in passing that not only does he \u201close very little with [these types of] meetings\u201d, but that Maduro\u2019s principal opposition, Juan Guaid\xf3, might not be up to the job.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The White House later did damage control, listing out Trump\u2019s record on Venezuela and embellishing some of his rhetoric. The fast-paced response from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is, again, evidence to suggest that the team around Trump does understand the damage the U.S. president will do to his re-election chances if he appears weak on Venezuela, and loses voters in South Florida.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The message \u201cTough on Venezuela\u201d also plays well in other corners of the Republican party. Namely, foreign policy hawks that see an encroaching Russia and China on what they likely refer to as America\u2019s \u201cbackyard\u201d. The issue of China, in particular, is no longer a bipartisan issue in Washington, and both Republicans and Democrats are increasingly weary of Beijing\u2019s influence in Caracas\u2014even though most Democrats might seem reticent to admit that fact.\xa0\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Indeed, Trump\u2019s stance in support of a democratic transition of power in Venezuela, and removing it from Beijing\u2019s sphere of influence is one of the few issues where the Democratic camp cannot fault Trump\u2019s policy, or come up with a credible rebuttal. These types of policy stances with no easy comeback tend to come up, especially during presidential debates.\xa0</span></p>\\n<blockquote><p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The fact is, however, that Trump has shown more restraint\xa0 in the past three years than former presidents in committing U.S. soldiers to open-ended wars.</span></p></blockquote>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As the campaign heats up, assuming that the ongoing pandemic allows the public and the press to scrutinize candidates, how far will Trump go with \u201cTough on Venezuela\u201d? According to several former staffers and some sitting Latin American presidents, Trump has repeatedly signaled his willingness for a \u201cmilitary solution\u201d. The fact is, however, that Trump has shown more restraint\xa0 in the past three years than former presidents in committing U.S. soldiers to open-ended wars. More importantly, Trump\u2019s core WASP base is likely malleable enough to follow his rhetoric and even repeat it, but might find it a little more difficult to internalize the arguments to support a war in a foreign country.\xa0</span></p>\\n<h2><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The Danger of False Hope</span></h2>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Now, like much of what happens in Washington, the election\u2019s rhetoric or its messaging will not remain inside U.S. borders. Washington politics is, at best, entertainment for much of the Western world. At worst, a form of delusion which forces people to imagine a vested interest in candidates that are running for a foreign office, in a foreign country, in a foreign continent\u2014and there lies one great danger.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Hope isn\u2019t a strategy, and much less when it\u2019s being delivered by a person who\u2019s morally incompetent. \u201cTough on Venezuela\u201d will likely play well in Florida where Cuban voters next to Venezuelan, Colombian, and Argentine minorities will find in it a reassuring policy stance. But for those in Venezuela, the same message will carry other meanings that might instill a false hope of foreign intervention that\u2019s dangerous.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It\u2019s that false hope that someone else will come and remedy our faults which has led in part to Venezuela\u2019s current social and political crisis. And by November\u2019s end, many Venezuelans are likely to be convinced that \u201csomeone\u201d is coming, purely because of bloated electoral rhetoric delivered by a candidate who has a vested interest in himself, not in 28 million people living across the Caribbean.</span></p>\\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Behind the public stance of the American president regarding our

Justice announced the approval of \u201cspecial rules\u201d for the elections of December 2020. Even though they kept the current 87 circuits, the number of deputies to be elected is being arbitrarily changed from 167, to 277. Because of this imposition, 130 seats and three indigenous deputies will be elected nominally, and 144 will be elected with closed lists, 96 on lists per state and 48 on national lists. Even though in the last few years five million people have left the country, the TSJ\u2019s CNE increased the number of deputies by 66%, 110 more seats, using the argument of population representation. According to the illegitimate National Constituent Assembly, there should now be more deputies to represent citizens. What they\u2019re really doing is guaranteeing quotas for the small parties that took part in chavismo\u2019s dialogue roundtable. In the session on Monday morning, AN deputies reiterated they won\u2019t participate in legislative elections called by the CNE. On the other hand, Javier Bertucci, member of Nicol\xe1s\u2019s pr\xeat-\xe0-porter opposition, said that the elections could be on December 6th or 13th.\xa0</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">On Tuesday, the National Assembly ratified the proposal of a political agreement calling for free, fair and transparent presidential elections. Deputies approved the agreement recognizing the need to assemble all public powers and rescuing the institutional counterweight to save democracy. The document is precise about the conditions: reestablishing voting rights for all Venezuelans, which is why the National Electoral Registry must be audited, and guaranteeing voting without coercion. They also demanded that everyone be allowed to run, the end of trials and prison for opposition politicians and the reestablishment of participation rights for them and their parties, including the use of their symbols, colors and assets. They want a new Electoral Branch appointed by the National Assembly, and a timetable for the elections, including all processes being audited, as qualified electoral observation of every part of the process. They exhorted the international community to pressure Nicol\xe1s\u2019s regime to achieve this.\xa0</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The ICJ decided to evaluate on Monday if they have jurisdiction to recognize Guyana\u2019s claim over Esequibo. Chavismo\u2019s team decided to not attend the session, arguing that Venezuela doesn\u2019t recognize the ICJ\u2019s jurisdiction over the territorial claim. Even without a representative from Venezuela, the session took place and the ICJ president confirmed that on November, 28th, 2019, Nicol\xe1s\u2019s regime submitted a document responding to Guyana. Dr. Thairi Moya explained that all member states of the UN are ipso facto part of the ICJ Statute: \u201cOur country has been left unaided in this hearing even though Venezuela only presented one document, Guyana\u2019s arguments have been convincing and aren\u2019t exclusively pertinent to what the Geneva Agreement states,\u201d she explained. After the hearing, not a single expert disagreed: Venezuela could \u201cpay a high price\u201d for not participating.

They also announced three deaths: a 77-year-old woman in Lara state, a 53-year-old man in Trujillo state and an 84-year-old man in Yaracuy state. Venezuela has had 5,832 cases and 51 deaths.\xa0</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Venezuelan oil production dropped for the sixth month in a row (32% in June), a drop of almost 200,000 daily barrels compared to the previous month, according to PDVSA and Oil Ministry documents reviewed by Bloomberg. On June 28th, production was 422,400 bpd.\xa0</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The National Assembly approved yesterday Unipetrol president and former PDVSA manager Horacio Medina\u2019s incorporation to the PDVSA\u2019s ad hoc board, a motion unsupported by the 16J faction. They also added Javier Linares Pe\xf1a, who was part of the CVP ad hoc board since October 2019 and Luis Antonio Vilchez Gallardo.\xa0</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The ANC-imposed prosecutor general reported that the ministry opened an investigation \u201cbecause of irregularities and excessive prices charged by CINEX for its drive in movie service.\u201d How much is a movie ticket isn\u2019t the state\u2019s problem, even less so in a country with the problems we have, but populism and price controls can provide some visibility.\xa0</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The EU\u2019s high representative for Foreign Policy, Josep Borrell, rejected on Tuesday Nicol\xe1s\u2019s decision to expel ambassador Isabel Brilhante Pedrosa, in retaliation for the sanctions issued against 11 officials. Borrell said that \u201cthey\u2019ll take the necessary reciprocal measures\u201d. Dita Charanzov\xe1, vice president of the European Parliament, rejected the decision and expressed she expects member states to take action. The UK will impose the same sanctions that the EU issued against Nicol\xe1s\u2019s regime, said Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and added: \u201cIt will show that human rights violations and spite for democracy in Venezuela won\u2019t be tolerated.\u201d Josep Borrell called Nicol\xe1s\u2019s ambassador in Brussels and European media says that \u201cit seems like Claudia Salermo will also be expelled when the pandemic allows it.\u201d\xa0</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The Russian government presented the terms of a debt restructuring process agreed with Nicol\xe1s\u2019s regime, showing that annual payments will increase five times starting 2023. Reuters reported that the details were included in a draft law presented in the Russian Parliament. Caracas has to pay Moscow 133 million dollars a year from 2019 to 2022. The figure later increases to 684 million between 2023 and 2026. The agreement, signed in 2018, contemplates a payment of 3,120 million dollars in capital and payment interests for 217 million. This plan hasn\u2019t been presented to the National Assembly. Deputy \xc1ngel Alvarado explained that \u201crestructuring debt in the shadows\u201d is \u201cillegal and won\u2019t be recognized by the Republic in the future.\u201d The Russian government and Rosneft have given chavismo around 17,000 million dollars in loans and credit lines since 2006.\xa0</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned China\u2019s and Russia\u2019s intimidation of the institutional authorities in their countries, in the context of the pandemic and the fact that the U.S. is denying the reality of the sanitary crisis. Michelle Bachelet said that \u201cCOVID-19 has been used to limit the people\u2019s right to express themselves and to participate in decisions that affect their lives.\u201d\xa0</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Colombian Foreign minister Claudia Blum assured that Iv\xe1n Duque\u2019s government will continue working \u201ctowards ending the usurpation of power in Venezuela, the creation of a plural transition government, the call for free and fair presidential elections and the possibility of reconstruction.\u201d She said that Colombia supports Juan Guaid\xf3, the National Assembly and the Venezuelan people.\xa0</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">By the way, the figure of Venezuelan migrants in Colombia dropped for the second month in a row, from 1,809,000 people in March to 1,788,380 people in April. Colombian Immigration called for accelerating the process of returning to Venezuela, respecting human rights. At least 81,000 Venezuelans have returned since March 14th. After the \u201ccoronaweather\u201d is over, many, many more could be crossing back into our country.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There\u2019ll be more deputies and only the government and its tailor-made opposition will run in the December elections;

This is just counting the ones within walking distance from where I sleep; there have been dozens in the city for the last months.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In a normal country, this would be the news of the day.

No one panicked; in fact, I was mildly annoyed that this last blast interrupted my Sunday nap. The general reaction was \u201cwell, there goes another transformer,\u201d but because we didn\u2019t lose the electric service, we didn\u2019t give it a second thought. Who cares about an explosion as long as the AC is still running, a major concern in this perpetually hot Maracaibo?</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">I realized that the last explosion was a grenade because my brother was frantically calling me from Argentina to see if my father and I were okay\u2026 interrupting my nap yet again. The news had already spread on social media (with all sorts of inaccuracies), so I walked to the site of the bang and, to my horror, I saw the neighborhood watchman in wrecks. Then I remembered that\u2019s just the way he looked before the grenade, too. There were no injuries, just some blown windows on</span> <span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">an abandoned house.

That\u2019s one theory. The truth is that there\u2019s no way of knowing the reason behind a series of grenade attacks in the city, if they have a political background or if they\u2019re extortion-related intimidation. This last scenario seems very likely, but there are no proper investigations by the authorities, and no investigations by the media (who definitely lack the means to do them). In our latest case, CICPC detectives came almost four hours after the incident, and didn\u2019t even set foot on the property where the explosion took place.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">One of my dearest friends, who shall remain nameless because of the delicate nature of the subject, is a business owner. He\u2019s had two grenade explosions in his place of work in the last few months, a prominent sports bar in the city. Evidently, he\u2019s not that comfortable addressing the issue, but he\u2019s very calm about it too. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s talking to me about the nuisance of dealing with bureaucracy, just the price of working here.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When I ask him about the authorities\u2019 reaction, he explains that they went to the site and basically acted as regular bystanders. They asked questions with the curiosity of a civilian witness and, the cherry on the top, they leaked the CCTV footage of the explosions in social media after they left, which is how I found out about the incident.</span></p>\\n<blockquote><p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Who cares about an explosion as long as the AC is still running?</span></p></blockquote>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There are comical aspects in this rather dark turn of events. The perpetrators, even though quite scary, also seem unprepared to handle dangerous weapons. You can see their haste on the videos. My neighborhood\u2019s watchman says that the young fellow who threw the grenade last Sunday, tripped at the time of the toss, which made me think that we almost had a \u201cWile E.

Venezuela is on its way to being the tragedy among the tragedy of COVID-19 deaths in Latin America,\u201d he said.

This was a great time for self-discovery, as Carlos had never felt comfortable in Venezuela, where he felt discriminated against for being gay.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In Hong Kong, Carlos discovered his passion for art, which led him to apply to colleges in the United States. He was accepted on a partial scholarship at Vassar College, in New York, and his family used the preferential exchange rate for tuition, provided by the now bitter legend that was CADIVI.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As Carlos took his courses at Vassar, his view of the world expanded. He decided to become an architect, planning projects with a focus on lower-income communities. He\u2019d quickly learn how truly elitist the architecture field can be, and that the system didn\u2019t always support these projects.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Getting approved for CADIVI also became increasingly difficult, until becoming an actual hurdle during his last semester, when Vassar informed him he wouldn\u2019t be able to graduate if the money didn\u2019t come through. Only at the very last minute CADIVI sent the payment. Before graduation, Carlos had applied for a Master\u2019s degree at Harvard, not thinking he had a chance; in 2015, he was admitted into one of the most prestigious universities in the world.</span></p>\\n<blockquote><p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Getting approved for CADIVI also became increasingly difficult, until becoming an actual hurdle during his last semester.</span></p></blockquote>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While he had a partial scholarship for Harvard, Carlos had to get an American credit to pay for part of the remaining amount. The rest of that first year tuition would be paid by his family, once again relying on the CADIVI system.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Although Carlos loved his time at Harvard, he was slightly disappointed about the limitations and micro-aggressions that came with being gay and Latino. Even in an institution that encourages diversity and equality, being an immigrant without a rich family wasn\u2019t easy.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">But he did thrive. He enjoyed a loving relationship and bright prospects for the future, but the CADIVI dollars vanished and the oil prices dropped in 2015. Out of options, and with thousands of dollars in debt, Carlos had to make the gut-wrenching decision to quit Harvard. He also had to leave the country immediately.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Carlos and his boyfriend went to Mexico for a short project. It was there where they said goodbye for good, as Carlos went back to Caracas and his boyfriend returned to the States. In Caracas, brokenhearted and adrift, Carlos found that a great number of his friends had left the country, and he still had a huge debt to pay, something impossible with Venezuelan salaries.</span></p>\\n<blockquote><p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Out of options, and with thousands of dollars in debt, Carlos had to make the gut-wrenching decision to quit Harvard.</span></p></blockquote>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">After sending his resume to hundreds of places, he finally got an offer from a company in Berlin, which he took. Although he didn\u2019t speak the language and his Latino identity separated him from the culture, he had friends in the city and its underground artsy culture was exactly what he needed. Carlos realized that he wanted to be in a place where being Latino wouldn\u2019t be a disadvantage; it was time to leave architecture behind and focus on the area he had worked in while in Mexico, user-centered design.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Carlos started to teach himself everything about his new trade while sending resumes once again, this time getting a response from Sao Paulo. It would be a huge change, but Carlos was ready to start once again, this time in Latin America.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Carlos moved to Sao Paulo in 2017, where he found acceptance of his Latino identity, and a sense of belonging that had been lacking for the past ten years of his life. He adapted to the culture and the language, finding himself such a match for the country that his Brazilian friends say \u201cCarlos, you ARE Brazilian!\u201d</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This will be literally true next year, when Carlos will get his Brazilian citizenship. He works at a startup with exciting plans for the future of banking in Latin America. Carlos is the lead researcher of the user-centered design section and, although Brazil is his true home, he hopes the things he\u2019s working on can one day be implemented in Venezuela.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">On one leg, Carlos has a reminder of where he has been, and a call to thrive: a the tattoo with flowers that represents the places where he has been and reminds him to always flourish wherever he is planted. And flourishing he is. </span></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The tale of Carlos, a truly international epic, will bring you back to the times of CADIVI, where

I celebrate Luis Lecuna\u2019s bravery (Eva Leal\u2019s nephew), who not only recorded the video that went viral, but who denounced on Thursday morning the irregular treatment she endured and assured she was taken to court in secret. Eva Leal shouldn\u2019t have been a victim of extortion, or beaten for refusing to pay. She shouldn\u2019t have been a victim of abuse of force or authority.

It was July 2016 and I actually felt like we were making history: the first Journalism class ever to come out of the Universidad de Los Andes\u2019s Merida campus. Venezuela was already in the throes of a crisis that even by then had taken too long to resolve, but we were beyond jadedness those days, maybe because we were excited about majoring in what we really wanted to do. I, for one, could see a bright future ahead.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There wasn\u2019t a day my classmates and I didn\u2019t spend together. We took every class in the same classroom, with the same teachers, exactly like you do in high school. It was a challenge, too, because the hours were demanding and we only had one to one and a half hours for lunch. The food in the cafeteria wasn\u2019t much to write home about, neither healthy nor enough. When they wouldn\u2019t give us protein, we\u2019d waste a lot of time looking to fill that absence so everyone, especially the men, could be full.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">But despite that, and despite the fact that I live ten minutes away from the university, I would stay for lunch, just to be near my classmates. We spent most of our time in the woods, pretty much celebrating our friendship with talks or UNO games.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The day to day was harder for people who lived far away, like Sim\xf3n, who lived an hour from campus. His family didn\u2019t have much money, so he started working when we started our second year. You could see how tired he was, physically and mentally, but I admired him, because he, the person who was having the worst time in the entire class, was encouraging and supporting us. I\u2019d say to myself, \u201cIf he can do it, I can.\u201d</span></p>\\n<figure id=\\"attachment_80916\\" class=\\"wp-caption alignnone\\" style=\\"max-width: 1018px;\\" itemprop=\\"image\\" itemscope itemtype=\\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\\"><a href=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20190628-WA0065.jpg\\" data-fancybox=\\"image\\"><img data-attachment-id=\\"80916\\" data-permalink=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/2020/06/26/how-many-of-us-will-graduate/img-20190628-wa0065/\\" data-orig-file=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20190628-WA0065.jpg\\" data-orig-size=\\"1008,756\\" data-comments-opened=\\"0\\" data-image-meta=\\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\\" data-image-title=\\"IMG-20190628-WA0065\\" data-image-description=\\"\\" data-medium-file=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20190628-WA0065-300x225.jpg\\" data-large-file=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20190628-WA0065.jpg\\" class=\\"wp-image-80916 size-full\\" src=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20190628-WA0065.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"1008\\" height=\\"756\\" srcset=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20190628-WA0065.jpg 1008w, https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20190628-WA0065-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20190628-WA0065-768x576.jpg 768w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px\\" /></a><figcaption itemprop=\\"caption\\"><h6>The first generation of journalists for this particular university would see many obstacles\u2014and desertions\u2014as the national crisis deepened.

The will to share was there, but money, in this savage hyperinflation, was becoming a more present issue. \u201cI\u2019ll pay half, you pay the other half,\u201d we used to say. The plan was to not leave anyone behind.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">But the crisis grew, and we weren\u2019t the only ones suffering because right about then, the protests against Nicol\xe1s Maduro\u2019s regime erupted, and the university closed down. We had the advantage of taking classes remotely, or at someone\u2019s house because, being the first Journalism class, there were very few of us. So the demonstrations raged, but we didn\u2019t stop.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">I remember that, after everything settled down, I went to get dinner in the cafeteria and they only put an orange on the tray. There was also a transport union strike and routes with buses provided by the university stopped working too, because they needed repairs and parts that the university couldn\u2019t afford.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Professors began quitting. We could see how unmotivated they were, unable to tell if they were encouraging us to study or to quit. It was then when the idea of dropping out started crossing some of our minds.

We barely hung out now and none of us had time to stay and talk. I didn\u2019t even know where my UNO cards were; the moments we had together were reduced to class or journalism practice. In 2019, the trend continued, with only eight of us left. The moments of closeness and kinship returned, although not as often as before. Being so close to the finish line (it was our second to last year) gave us renewed energy. We started picturing our graduation, from the gala in the </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">aula magna,</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> to the actual celebration party.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">We excited our professors with our vibes, and they took every chance to cheer us up, being prime examples themselves of resilience and progress during adversity. The university seemed to recover its spirit, the faculty wasn\u2019t as deserted anymore.

We were that hyped, again.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">And just two weeks from ending our fourth school year, the COVID-19 pandemic erupted in Venezuela. Classes are not just over; we don\u2019t even know when we\u2019ll be coming back to our university, a struggle that despite our strongest will and dedication, insists on prolonging itself. A drama that we\u2019re surely not the only ones to suffer in a nation where students live with the same question in their minds:</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">How many of us will graduate, and when?</span></p>\\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The first class of Journalism at M\xe9rida\u2019s Universidad de los Andes campus started in July 2016, with 25 students.

The deaths of these babies are added to the serious record established by Nicol\xe1s\u2019s regime, that they\u2019ve tried to cover up in many ways, but is also one of the reasons they\u2019ve stopped publishing the weekly epidemiology bulletin since 2016. Chavismo hasn\u2019t developed public policy for our circumstances: in Venezuela, very few people can afford methods for planning a family, teenage pregnancy is abundant and common and because of the malnutrition figures and the vulnerability of pregnant women has increased.

In 2016, Nicol\xe1s warned that he wouldn\u2019t allow his own removal, and even fired over a thousand public workers for signing for the referendum against him. Journalist Eugenio Mart\xednez shared this fact: \u201cThe petition of the 2017 referendum is still suspended without resolution in files (by orders of five state criminal courts). In addition (&#8230;) CNE changed, modified and altered the rules for requesting a referendum.\u201d However, Nicol\xe1s\u2019s pr\xeat-\xe0-porter opposition started playing its role: pretending to be listening and writing messages about the pertinence of a referendum.

But it\u2019s also work surrounded by people who want to strengthen their communities by helping each other.\u201d</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The most recent poll by the World Food Programme, released in February 2020 with data collected from July until September 2019, registers that over nine million Venezuelans don\u2019t have access to food, even if it\u2019s available, due to hyperinflation and the high price of products; 60% of the population has had to cut down on their food portions, and four out of ten homes have to deal with irregular water supply and power outages. The study claims that the lack of food is a problem that hits the entire country, but in states like Delta Amacuro, Amazonas, and Falc\xf3n, it\u2019s more severe. Even in areas that report lower indexes, such as Lara, Cojedes, and M\xe9rida, it\u2019s estimated that one in five people are <a href=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/2019/05/05/fao-warns-about-a-real-possibility-of-famine-in-venezuela/\\">at risk of malnutrition</a>.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Landaeta explains that our crisis began in 2002, when an important economic contraction took place along with a sucker punch to national production. \u201cConfiscations began that year, as well as a strict control on national production when the government got involved in the production process. The government thought at the time, since they had the money, that they could import food. Unfortunately that prosperity period didn\u2019t last long and our agriculture was producing less. Today we produce between 18% and 20% of what Venezuela demands. Monitoring agricultural activity in the country has taken place and it\u2019s astonishing how the meat and grain consumption has dropped, according to collected data. The amount of available calories in the country accounts for 52% of the required needs of the population, and 64% if we talk about animal protein.\u201d</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Now, only three months after the first alarm on the pandemic, the UN publishes a report that states that a famine can develop in about three dozen countries because of COVID-19, and Venezuela is among the top ten. According to the parameters established by the UN, a situation can be labelled as famine when there\u2019s an extreme lack of food for a high amount of people. In other words, when the problem affects a population or region large enough to generate epidemics or health issues of magnitude; acute malnutrition rates reach 30% of the residents; the brute mortality rates surpass 2 per 10,000 people, per day.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">However, Landaeta suggests that acute malnutrition rates aren\u2019t always considered at those levels, and they\u2019re difficult to reach in places where social realities differ greatly to what these organizations have reported, like countries devastated by armed conflicts or natural disasters.</span></p>\\n<p><b>What\u2019s the current situation regarding hunger and malnutrition in Venezuela?</b></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In general, people depend entirely on the CLAP boxes, which have deficient distribution (they don\u2019t reach all areas and they don\u2019t come in regularly). Each box contains 10 kgs of food, and that\u2019s barely enough for a family of five to eat five days; 1,300 calories a day, when the minimum requirement is 2,300. What do people do to eat the remaining days? We don\u2019t know, beyond them trying to stretch out the food as much as possible. We\u2019ve seen the effect of weight loss and growth in the child malnutrition indexes. Cases of clinical malnutrition are more common each day, with the aggravating fact that it\u2019s happening to smaller children, under a year or six months old.</span></p>\\n<blockquote><p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">&#8220;In general, people depend entirely on the CLAP boxes, which have deficient distribution (they don\u2019t reach all areas and they don\u2019t come in regularly).&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\\n<p><b>Which are the consequences of malnutrition during childhood?</b></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Childhood is a period of fast growth and if you don\u2019t have the calories needed, essential fatty acids and amino acids can affect proper development. We\u2019re worried that these malnutrition levels at such an early age can affect intellectual capacity. Children who survive can be left with <a href=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/2018/11/10/i-saw-kids-fainting-from-hunger-in-the-classroom-so-i-decided-to-do-something-about-it/\\">serious learning disabilities</a>, they will require special needs education, and they probably won\u2019t have access to it. These injuries can be irreversible. Another precipitating factor is that, in Venezuela, 23% of pregnancies come from teenagers, girls who start their pregnancy already malnourished, and in turn give birth to children with low muscle mass. In this case, we\u2019re also talking about girls without access to birth control.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Social problems usually blend into each other and that\u2019s why we insist that malnutrition problems aren\u2019t related only to food access. The state has to guarantee access to drinkable water, vaccination campaigns and clean spaces where infectious diseases, like diarrhea, could develop if left unchecked. Without a public health system, the population becomes vulnerable, and this includes worsening their malnutrition.</span></p>\\n<p><b>We usually focus on child malnutrition, but the elderly folks are also a group at risk of malnourishment, because it\u2019s impossible for them to regain body mass that was lost.</b></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The last yearly report by the </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Convite</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> organization claims that the elderly are losing one kilogram per week, on average.</span></p>\\n<p><b>In the Global Risk Report by the World Economic Forum, two problems are identified as the main cause for starvation: a failed government and financial disparity. What would the relationship be between Venezuelan politics and economy with the current malnutrition situation?</b></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In the case of Venezuela, they\u2019re completely related. From the economic point of view, we\u2019re diminished and the possibility to help people in economic matters is low. There\u2019s a lot of unemployment and a lot of dependency on bonuses. Currently, within the pandemic frame, there hasn\u2019t been any political or economic solution to correct the situation. We need integral policies that won\u2019t leave the population alone in the midst of a political crisis. It seems like the political players (both representing the government and the opposition) are waiting for a famine to happen so that they take action, but one of the peculiarities of malnutrition is that most of those who suffer it, survive it.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There\u2019s an initiative coordinated by a number of UN organizations to approach the situation through humanitarian aid, but it all ends up falling in the same vicious circle in which the government intervenes and tries to hide the severity of the problem. The poll carried out by the World Food Programme claims that there were 9.3 million people at risk of malnutrition in Venezuela. The government simply disregarded the report and said it was false. And while the reality is being twisted, no one makes effective decisions and it\u2019s impossible to plan on cut short bases.</span></p>\\n<p><b>Which public policies can be put in place to start guaranteeing food supply for Venezuelans?</b></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In countries that have successfully fought against malnutrition, health care specially focused on children has been fundamental: from prenatal care to vaccinations, food supply, and growth and development control. Nothing is done overnight, they\u2019re very slow processes that require big political commitments for a long term project. In Chile, it took between 10 to 15 years to battle their malnutrition problem, but they succeeded. No development is possible if the population is poor and malnourished. It\u2019s not about being able to give out a box of food, but to guarantee the required food to each family.</span></p>\\n<blockquote><p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">&#8220;A malnourished child is an abandoned child.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\\n<p><b>In Chile, when the protests began in October, the motto was social dignity and the government talked about how effective feeding programs were. Now, barely three months after the pandemic alarm, new protests are arising and the motto is hunger. Many countries are presenting a rise in food supply issues, but the report published by the UN says that a famine can be established in Venezuela because of the pandemic.</b></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In the context of the pandemic, everything becomes much harder for many countries, like we\u2019ve seen in Latin America. Some specialists say that the year 2020 could end with 250 million people starving around the world, compared to the 135 million we currently have. Venezuela needs foreign help with food supply to compensate for the drop in national production. But the problem now is that many countries are going through a massive economic and productive contraction. This means more countries are asking for international support. Besides, in Venezuela there\u2019s fewer access to resources thanks to the imposed sanctions. Venezuela already lost the grain and cereal harvest that takes place this time of year, and we were already only producing 8% of the corn we consume. We don\u2019t only need food, we also need the materials for agriculture while the fuel crisis, and the water and electricity outages worsen the situation. There\u2019s less food in Venezuela each day, and that\u2019s so for the whole world.</span></p>\\n<p><b>The Bengoa Foundation is working to improve the nutrition in communities, monitoring the state of Venezuelans\u2019 diet, and fostering information on food and nutrition. How has the organization changed, what\u2019s its reach, and the requirements needed to support the people during the pandemic?</b></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">We have people who work already in each of the communities we deal with, so moving to places isn\u2019t much of a problem. Food supply is being done through safe conducts and we seek donations, too. Inflation has affected us a lot, because the money we receive loses its value very quickly. It\u2019s not only the need to fulfil the requirements presented by those who fund us, it\u2019s also a moral commitment in the country\u2019s most difficult moment. But now, more than ever, I\u2019m seeing people trying to earn strength by helping others.</span></p>\\n<p><b>Beyond the relationship between malnutrition and the social, political, and economic environment, there\u2019s also a spiritual dimension to food.</b></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">One of the things we work with is the emotional side. A malnourished child is an abandoned child. We work hard in rescuing the custom of eating as a family, that people acknowledge that moment as a loving space. There\u2019s a strong emotional bond when parents feed and look after their children. We also want to convey the importance of feeling pleasure when you eat, because eating stimulates all senses. The most important emotional link in a family originates at the dinner table. This fundamental social dynamic in a family happens at the dinner table. That\u2019s why we insist that feeding people isn\u2019t just about handing out food.</span></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Researcher Maritza Landaeta has seen how Venezuela reached this point of severe malnutrition and knows how to reverse it</p>\\n","protected":false},"author":2147,"featured_media":80909,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":""},"categories":[1007],"tags":[996,952],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DRA-MARITZA-NUTRICIONISTA20190912CESAR-SUAREZ-0005-1536x1024-2.jpg","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"yoast_head":"\x3c!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.0.4 -

Completed around a year ago, this building is elegance personified with a spacious, two-story lobby befitting the headquarters of a sizable and respected company. The main peculiarity of the building resides in its modern, asymmetrical design and usage of imported tiling elements, incongruent in a country that has stagnated at all levels of the industry.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Since its completion, this building has had no tenants, dependents or employees working within its walls. There are no furnishings or equipment of any kind, leaving a hollow, empty building with no prospects of future usage. It\u2019s merely an example of many buildings in Maracaibo, that continue to be built even when the market seems to be completely deflated.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Maracaibo, one of the hardest-hit cities in the Venezuelan diaspora and refugee crisis, is quietly having a construction Renaissance.</span></p>\\n<h2><b>Business-wise and Ironically Safe</b></h2>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The construction industry had initially met its death near the start of the hyperinflationary crisis in 2014. When faced with rising prices across the board and a complete collapse of production of essential construction components such as rebars and cement, companies had to severely cut costs and lay off employees in order to stay afloat. Its killing blow, however, occurred simultaneously with the rapid decline of the Venezuelan economy. A severe economic crisis eliminated any desire or means for investment into construction projects, plummeting the demand for an already struggling industry. Any ongoing construction was paused indefinitely and only the sturdiest of companies were able to survive, leaving only a shadow of a previously solid sector.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In late 2018, in the midst of an ever-deepening crisis, there seemed to be an outward appearance of healing. Restaurants were refurbished and reopened, expansive and luxurious houses were built, and the previously abandoned buildings found the necessary investors in order to finance their completion. However, much like the newly built modern office building, these positive trends were merely a pleasant fa\xe7ade. These projects were misattuned to the harsh reality of Venezuela today and can be seen as the expression of the new Venezuelan elite class known as </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">enchufados.</span></i></p>\\n<blockquote><p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Maracaibo, one of the hardest-hit cities in the Venezuelan diaspora and refugee crisis, is quietly having a construction Renaissance.</span></p></blockquote>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The widespread wealth and standing of the </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">enchufados</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> are well known by Venezuelans. Having personal or business connections within the regime have enabled them to exponentially expand their influence, as well as share in the systemic plundering of the country\u2019s coffers. Nonetheless, recent tensions between the international community and the Bolivarian government have led to an existential crisis for the </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">enchufados,</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> and sanctions on people with ties to the Maduro government or who otherwise have unaccounted wealth from Venezuelan business dealings, have left them scrambling for any means to retain, exploit, and legitimize their wealth. With restrictions to their properties abroad, </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">enchufados</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> have looked inward for investment opportunities as well as methods to effectively launder their money. Even if the local authority isn\u2019t actively searching for illicit capital, there still exists a need to legitimize it due to external pressures and safeguards for the shifting tides of government.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While mainstream culture has popularized the idea of nail-salons or laundromats as ways of laundering money, construction projects have often been overlooked as one of the most common methods for the activity, since they tend to reach exorbitant prices. There is the added benefit of Venezuela\u2019s exploited labor class, who having very little alternative and recourse, can be paid informally in cash. In fact, the labor class itself isn\u2019t the only one being paid this way, as recent restrictions have forced the wealthy to pay contracting companies in cash, as well.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Plots of land and buildings are also optimal as investment opportunities, due to their inherent value. While they may be susceptible to swings in valuation, along with the dollar, they are considered as one of the most valuable assets to own. With the property market at an all-time low, purchasing and refurbishing abandoned projects can seem like a solid investment and a way to garner influence and legitimacy in a hypothetical post-Maduro Venezuela. This also represents a safeguard in the current political landscape, seeing how the current regime has an inherent complicity between all the actors in the play: anyone who steps out of line can immediately be accused of corruption and jailed, ensuring their full loyalty.</span></p>\\n<h2><b>Turning Dirty Money Into Clean Bricks</b></h2>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">So how exactly would this system work? Let\u2019s say you\u2019re an </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">enchufado</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> and you\u2019ve earned your wealth thanks to your close yet well-hidden association with the Maduro government. You own a series of international bank accounts, yet you have to be wary, as any wealth coming out of Venezuela is closely audited. With such an ample supply of cash, your only recourse is to invest locally. There are a couple of abandoned projects that could be bought cheaply and then have their price inflated, or maybe it\u2019s possible to open a restaurant or </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">bodeg\xf3n</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> as an additional source of income, and maybe even as a hobby.\xa0</span></p>\\n<blockquote><p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The current regime has an inherent complicity between all the actors in the play: anyone who steps out of line can immediately be accused of corruption and jailed, ensuring their full loyalty.</span></p></blockquote>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Whatever your choice may be, the outcome is that you now own an inherently valuable asset instead of having money that would be unusable outside of Venezuela. Now, with your newly completed asset, you can wait and choose to sell it to those with legitimate means, or you can find a way to make it productive. This is why investments done with legitimate and illegitimate money are virtually indistinguishable.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This system seems to be emblematic of the Maduro regime as a whole. Having criminals being able to gain legitimacy through their ill-gotten wealth, portrays the sad reality facing many Venezuelans: the new normal involves a cohabitation with the new political elite who pillaged the country and now seek to erase the past.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Yet one can also see the willful ignorance of this new ruling class, believing that this rough-shod economy would be able to sustain itself through sheer force of will. It relies on the possibility to gain and make investments with illicit funds, yet the regime\u2019s purse strings are increasingly restrained; it relies on finding legitimate investors or customers in order to legitimize and maintain a mechanism for productivity, yet millions of Venezuelans flee in droves and the middle class is all but destroyed.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The new office tower is like the industry that it currently represents, a vacant husk held up by its slowly deteriorating fa\xe7ade. It\u2019s a representation of a time when Venezuela had some degree of productivity and raison </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">d&#8217;\xeatre</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, but now it&#8217;s merely a prop, utilized by those in power to sustain their declining existence.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A city of empty monuments for an elite that rules over no one, clinging on a broken system that will also bring their downfall one day.</span></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Despite an economy in shambles the construction business is reactivating .

Celso Fantinel highlighted that corn, rice, sugar cane and coffee crops are drastically dropping: \u201cWe could maybe produce 20% to 25% of Venezuelans\u2019 needs,\u201d he said. He added that Venezuelans\u2019 purchasing power makes buying imported goods really difficult. Fedeagro registered that coffee production is around 400,000 and 450,000 quintals, which is barely enough for four months. Fantinel emphasized that the agricultural sector has been in decline since 2010: \u201cIn 2008 and 2009 we reached almost 700,000 hectares of corn.

Deputy and head of the Esequibo Defense Committee Williams D\xe1vila reiterated that the position of Nicol\xe1s\u2019s regime on the Esequibo hasn\u2019t been strong enough and insisted that the controversial issue made it all the way to this institution because of chavismo\u2019s laziness, because they paid more attention to the political strategy of buying votes at Caricom and obeyed Cuba\u2019s order to \u201cstop pushing for\u201d the Guyana topic.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Nicol\xe1s\u2019s Defense minister, Vladimir Padrino L\xf3pez, said that Colombian authorities and paramilitary groups encourage Venezuelans, many of them infected by the virus, to return to Venezuela through illegal passageways.

What he reinvented from national folkloric genres starting at its roots, in order to create a new sound that was far removed from any innocent layering. What he blended with electronic, rock, funk, blues, salsa, symphonic music, and even hip-hop in an eternal innovation journey that matched his love for the beach, surf, karate, languages, cats, his family life, and a deep spirituality. A life, you might say, that\u2019s an allegory of jazz.</span></p>\\n<h2><b>From Vienna to La Guaira</b></h2>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">But none of that has happened yet. For now, young Gerhard Weilheim is 17 years old, and is on a train ride with his mother and stepfather to Genoa, where he takes a transatlantic boat to the New World. He saw then, from the prow, the bright colors that glistened from the port of La Guaira in an early morning in 1957. \u201cI\u2019m staying here,\u201d he told himself, and burned his sails in Caraballeda.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\u201cWe lived there for two years. I worked as a night doorman in the Santa Mar\xeda building of the Puerto Azul Club. They\u2019d give me the keys at night and I found out that they had a piano brought in for the opening of the El Gale\xf3n club. I would sneak in, and since I was blond, people didn\u2019t think I was an employee,\u201d he laughs. \u201cAnd I would sit down to practice. The building managers realized I played a bit, doubled my salary and allowed me to play in the club restaurant at noon.\u201d</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Two years ago he played that same piano, in that same club (now as a member), and two years after his arrival, he settled in Caracas, teaching himself the piano with eight to ten hour long sessions, every day, for thirty years.</span></p>\\n<h2><b>Daring Jazz</b></h2>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The story of what came later is compiled in 16 records. At least that\u2019s the number recalled by his son and manager, Gerhard Weilheim, whose excitement when he talks about Gerry has no boundaries. His debut album, </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">El Quinteto de Jazz de Gerry Weil</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> (1968), is made up of covers of some of his influences and gives a glimpse into his first compositions, like \u201cExpressions N\xb01\u201d, an acid jazz soaked in the hippie psychedelia of the times. </span><a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J3NBg8Uow8\\"><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">El Mensaje</span></i></a> <span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">(1970) has a cleaner sound, with six original songs that can be defined as big band rock. In the zenith of that creative moment, from that five-piece band, one of the most avant-garde sounding bands was born: </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">La Banda Municipal</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\u201cWe were so avant-garde that no label would record us. Vytas (Brenner) recorded albums like </span><a href=\\"https://open.spotify.com/?utm_source=web-player&amp;utm_campaign=bookmark\\"><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Ofrenda</span></i></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> because it was more mainstream. But we were the crazy ones at the time. I think we were ahead of our time. If you listen to </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">La Banda Municipal</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> today, it sounds current.\u201d</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Weil remembers those years when the group was a cult reference amongst music lovers, who enjoyed their only live recorded performance (Valencia Municipal Theater, 1974) in bootlegged cassette tapes sold by street vendors in the Plaza de los Museos, in Caracas. Fortunately, journalist Gregorio Montiel Cupello rescued a copy of that recording thirty years later, producing the only legitimate and remastered register of the band to date.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">But the band\u2019s days were numbered: several of its members took on other projects, including Weil, who would quit a year before the group\u2019s dissolution in search of a spirituality that, from the hippie point of view, can only be found distancing yourself from the system, and being in contact with nature. They used to call it \u201cthe drop-out\u201d.</span></p>\\n<h2><b>M\xe9rida: The Journey</b></h2>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Weilheim Jr. remembers cheerfully his childhood in the mist, natural spring water and wildlife. Without electricity, the life of the Weilheims (Gerry, his wife Omaira, and their sons Alexander and Gerhard) would go by among rose bushes, fruit and vegetable crops. Meditation, reading the classics and music were their daily chores in a small farm between Jaj\xed and La Azulita, M\xe9rida state in the Venezuelan Andes, where Gerry began to study Bach and wrote songs like \u201c</span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Ma\xf1ana de campo en abril</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\u201d.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\u201cI always head for the countryside, in every way!\u201d he laughs. \u201cLike a leopard, I never change my spots!\u201d</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">But the trip had a return ticket. The need to raise their sons in civilization made them return to Caracas, where reality slaps the maestro in the face. Without any income or a home of his own, he understood that six years away from the system doesn\u2019t go by without consequences. It was 1981. The world had changed.</span></p>\\n<h2><b>Gerry, The Maestro</b></h2>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A mandatory adjective in Gerry Weil\u2019s life is \u201cteacher,\u201d as four generations of musicians trained in almost 40 years can attest. Maybe not everyone knows his name, but many know of his students. \u201cThe place occupied by Gerry in music education in Venezuela is huge,\u201d says his biographer and author of </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Al ritmo de Gerry Weil, </span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Cristina Raffalli</span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">.</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> \u201cThe part it takes in building a country is enormous, because when you spend 40 years of your life passionately dedicated to your students, it\u2019s a unique kind of work for your country. He educated not only with a musical vision, but also teaching attitude towards the creation, veneration, and respect of music.\u201d\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Guitarist Diego Ayala confirms this mystic sense of the maestro:</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\u201cHe\u2019ll make you feel an incredible humbleness towards the mystery of music. How lucky we are to play with something so abstract and mysterious. That we can understand it little by little by studying and practicing it.\u201d</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This is perhaps one of the maestro\u2019s more known faces. What few people know is that he began this practice as soon as he arrived in Caracas, after that drop-out.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\u201cI started teaching with my bicycle all over Caracas. I would put up flyers in pharmacies and supermarkets promoting \u2018music lessons.\u2019\u201d</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Urban legend says that, at the time, Weil had mail ordered lessons from the famous Berklee College of Music, but the reality is different:</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\u201cI never enrolled at Berklee. I had a student who did enrol in the eighties, but he didn\u2019t speak English. So he would pay me to study the lessons they gave him and I would tutor him by explaining the assignments. He graduated, I learned, and I registered all that in my system. Indirectly I was a Berklee teacher.\u201d</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Raffalli\u2019s vision from her experience with Weil\u2019s students is that he teaches what every good teacher must: the sense of freedom when creating something. Finding their own artistic voice as a reflection of themselves. And Diego Ayala remembers the maestro\u2019s definition of music like a mantra:</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\u201cA gesture of love to us by the divine and our answer with passion and thankfulness.\u201d</span></p>\\n<h2><b>The Spiritual Side of Music</b></h2>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">That spirituality has also impregnated his work, witnessed in his latest album, </span><a href=\\"https://open.spotify.com/?utm_source=web-player&amp;utm_campaign=bookmark\\"><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Kosmic Flow</span></i></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, an album where the jazz and hip-hop fusion base makes the word \u201cexperimental\u201d fit into a genre that by definition, is experimental. Swing and R&amp;B melodies appear with funk guitar strums, reggae figures and an ever-present hip-hop sample beat that would even make it in a trap song.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">One thing this album has to boast about are the collaborations, the distinctive feature in any hip-hop album. </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Kosmic Flow</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> gathers artists within the genre, such as Apache, Afreeka, Ron Lion The Monster, the band Free Convict, beatboxer Jhoabeat, Sibilino (former Tres Due\xf1os), OneChot, McKlopedia, and the veteran Costa Rican hip-hop artist Toledo.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Other guests include, besides beats and rhymes, guitarist Rafael Antol\xednez (Caramelos de Cianuro and Le Cinema), Henry D\u2019Arthenay (La Vida Boheme), Chipi Chac\xf3n, vocalists Laura Guevara, Hana Kobayashi, Liana Malva, and Trina Medina, drummer Orestes G\xf3mez, and the Venezuelan music youth band Ensamble B11. This album was recorded and produced between Vienna, Caracas, Medell\xedn, Miami, and Mexico City. The artwork was created by Brooklyn-based Venezuelan designer Luispa, and reproduction was made in New York.</span></p>\\n<p><a href=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kosmic-Flow.jpg\\" data-fancybox=\\"image\\"><img data-attachment-id=\\"80892\\" data-permalink=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/2020/06/21/the-venezuelan-jazz-hippie-that-never-stopped-reinventing-himself/kosmic-flow/\\" data-orig-file=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kosmic-Flow.jpg\\" data-orig-size=\\"1080,1080\\" data-comments-opened=\\"0\\" data-image-meta=\\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\\" data-image-title=\\"Kosmic-Flow\\" data-image-description=\\"\\" data-medium-file=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kosmic-Flow-300x300.jpg\\" data-large-file=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kosmic-Flow-1024x1024.jpg\\" class=\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-80892\\" src=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kosmic-Flow.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"1080\\" height=\\"1080\\" srcset=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kosmic-Flow.jpg 1080w, https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kosmic-Flow-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kosmic-Flow-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kosmic-Flow-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kosmic-Flow-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kosmic-Flow-500x500.jpg 500w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\\" /></a> <a href=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200608-WA0022.jpg\\" data-fancybox=\\"image\\"><img data-attachment-id=\\"80893\\" data-permalink=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/2020/06/21/the-venezuelan-jazz-hippie-that-never-stopped-reinventing-himself/img-20200608-wa0022/\\" data-orig-file=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200608-WA0022.jpg\\" data-orig-size=\\"1080,1080\\" data-comments-opened=\\"0\\" data-image-meta=\\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\\" data-image-title=\\"IMG-20200608-WA0022\\" data-image-description=\\"\\" data-medium-file=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200608-WA0022-300x300.jpg\\" data-large-file=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200608-WA0022-1024x1024.jpg\\" class=\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-80893\\" src=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200608-WA0022.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"1080\\" height=\\"1080\\" srcset=\\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200608-WA0022.jpg 1080w, https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200608-WA0022-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200608-WA0022-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200608-WA0022-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200608-WA0022-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200608-WA0022-500x500.jpg 500w\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\\" /></a></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">That\u2019s the music wrapping for songs like </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Ima Koko Ni</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> (Here and Now, in Japanese), a hip-hop track that pays tribute to Venezuela and where the five principles of Reiki are recited: \u201cJust for today, do not worry, do not be angry, be grateful, work eagerly and honestly,\xa0 be kind.\u201d </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Rap de las Tortugas</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> carries an environmental message;

Sim\xf3n Bol\xedvar Big Band Jazz </span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">(2019). And although he maintains that 16 albums is a small number considering his musical trajectory, his work is taken as musical reference by artists in every genre across the country. That\u2019s where his producer side comes from too, which he defines as another way of teaching, because he guides the artist in music, art, and even spiritual concepts.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\u201cIt\u2019s not my forte, but a musician has to know about everything, including production.\u201d</span></p>\\n<p><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Primog\xe9nito</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, by Mar\xeda Rivas (1990); </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">En Descomposici\xf3n</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, by Desorden P\xfablico (1990); and the EP by the band Tulio Chuecos (2007) are the three records he\u2019s credited in as producer, not including the individual tracks he\u2019s worked on with other artists like OneChot. \u201cTulio Chuecos was a band made up of excellent musicians from the UCV\u2019s Architecture school. It was the closest thing to Radiohead in Venezuela,\u201d the maestro points out.</span></p>\\n<h2><b>Peace and Love</b></h2>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Those who know him agree that Gerry has one flaw: his stubbornness. But is it really a flaw for him?\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">One day in Vienna, when he was eight years old, he insisted so much that he wanted to be a musician that his grandmother took him to a conservatory. After he took the test, the music teacher concluded that his love of music was incompatible with his ear. His stubbornness would give him, 70 years later, poetic justice: in the same city where someone told him he would never be a musician, he recorded </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Live in Vienna</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, in 2018, in a crusade filled with the effort and sacrifice a young musician goes through.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It was the first album in this relaunching period, or how Weilheim calls it, \u201cthe rebirth\u201d of his father, after a bout with colon cancer</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\u2014</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">while not too serious, it was a wakeup call: with a music career such as his, he still couldn\u2019t afford the surgery.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\u201cI was at home with my mom and we called to say hello,\u201d guitarist Diego Ayala remembers. \u201cThat\u2019s when he tells us, rather anxiously, that they had found some tumours and that he didn\u2019t know how to get the money for the surgery. I never doubted the fact that we would be able to raise the funds, but I was surprised by everyone\u2019s generosity, how quickly we reached the goal and how we surpassed it.\u201d</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">From that moment on, his son Gerhard swore that as long as he was alive, he wouldn\u2019t allow that to happen again. So he\u2019s been his manager for three years. He\u2019s had not only to relaunch his father\u2019s career, but land him in the country\u2019s economic reality.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">At almost 81 years old, Weil continues to teach from his home in Sabana Grande, Caracas, and is working on international projects with his son. It\u2019s the least one could expect from someone who\u2019s hoping to reach 120 years of age making music and exploring new facets, like he did with surf and karate, with which he accompanied his two sons across the world as an athlete (karate) and team manager (surf). Never letting go of the woman that has kept him going: his wife, Omaira Gonz\xe1lez.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\u201cIf my soul had a Bol\xedvar Square (a must in all Venezuelan towns), I would put up a statue of Omaira in it. It would\u2019ve been impossible for me to achieve what I did with my life without the wonderful presence of this person that left everything behind; her career as an artist and dancer, to raise my children and be my life partner for fifty years of marriage, which we celebrated in August. She deserves a statue made of the best marble, or gold, for putting up with this nut,\u201d he says.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">That\u2019s how days go by for the maestro Weil, harvesting love, forgiveness, discipline, work, and happiness as a philosophy; a firm believer that you can only find these things inside you and you don\u2019t really need that much outside. In his case: being barefoot on the beach or at home, a cold beer, his daily meal and a tuned piano.

Additionally, they have made exceptions for </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">mobility restrictions during the pandemic, to cross-border humanitarian actions previously authorized by the health authorities.

Nicol\xe1s highlighted 46 cases of local infection, only to explain that 14 of those are tied to the outbreak in Las Pulgas market in Maracaibo and 13 are in Caracas. Delcy Rodr\xedguez mentioned five cases in the state of Miranda, four in Bol\xedvar, four in Falc\xf3n, three in Carabobo, two in M\xe9rida and one in Lara.

He asked citizens to denounce anyone who has used this method to come back to the country. Rodr\xedguez said that the \u201cvector of imported cases caused this situation\u201d and that the outbreak in Las Pulgas is responsible for 373 cases and it\u2019s the largest one. Nicol\xe1s said that he\u2019ll strengthen quarantine measures in Distrito Capital, Aragua, Bol\xedvar, Miranda, Vargas and Zulia and said that one of the suggestions is closing the Caracas\u2019 subway and stopping public transport, something he didn\u2019t confirm later.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The National Assembly expressed concern for the increase of COVID-19 cases in Venezuela in the last couple of weeks. Deputies warned that it\u2019s fake that Nicol\xe1s\u2019s regime has the pandemic under control and that it\u2019s too soon to soften measures. Deputies called on the population to protect itself with minimum protocols: constantly washing hands, using facemasks and social distancing. Deputy Manuela Bol\xedvar called infections in health workers a serious issue, as are active outbreaks in vulnerable populations, like Pemon and Wayuu peoples. She also warned about the impact of more flexible measures, saying that we\u2019ll see the results in two or three weeks, which could multiply contagion and reiterated the call for decentralizing PCR tests to increase diagnostic capabilities, a measure that was approved but hasn\u2019t been executed. Mar\xeda Teresa P\xe9rez said that in Venezuela, only 2% of tests are PCR, because of the low capacity of labs and because we don\u2019t have enough test kits.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The AN approved a rejection of the scheme to \u201csteal gas bought from Iran\u201d to deliver it to Cuba.

They moved to Latin America and the Caribbean. UNHCR\u2019s most recent report says that this is the largest exodus in the region\u2019s recent history, and it turns Venezuela into the second country with the most refugees in the world, after Syria. UNHCR estimates that countries in Latin America issued 2.4 million documents for residence and legal permanence to Venezuelans last year. \u201cIn the last few years, Venezuela has become the country with the largest asylum requests, over 341,000 in 2018 and 430,000 in 2019. They\u2019re abandoning their country because of several factors, including violence, persecution, political and economic crises,\u201d says the report.

He added that Donald Trump\u2019s government \u201cwill keep prosecuting sanction evaders, those who steal Venezuelan resources for personal gain, at the expense of the Venezuelan people.\u201d According to the OFAC, Nicol\xe1s\u2019s regime and PDVSA have cooperated with Saab to evade sanctions and sell Venezuelan oil since 2019.

I had to fight hard to get paid on time. I don\u2019t know if they didn\u2019t like the color of my skin, where I came from, or both.</span></p></blockquote>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\u201cDo you carry any resentment because of those mistreatments, Laurent?\u201d I ask.\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\u201cNo. Venezuela gave me the opportunity to work and the money to give my children an education. An education that I didn\u2019t have. But to go as far as saying that there isn\u2019t racism over there, that\u2019s a lie.\u201d</span></p>\\n<h2><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It\u2019s No Joke</span></h2>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Many of us grew up under the thought that discrimination was only a way to show endearment, or mere pranking. C\xe9sar, a psychologist and </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">caraque\xf1o</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, tells us how \u201conce, fresh out of the University, I applied for a job at a company that carries out polls. When I went for the interview, the girl that was in charge of selection scanned me from top to bottom and I knew right away that I wouldn\u2019t be hired. She asked me several questions, but they all focused on the typical Venezuelan clich\xe9s about black people.\u201d Clich\xe9s that are covered in generalizations: all of them are criminals, all of them are ignorant, all of them are poor.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Leo, a musician born in Caracas and currently living in M\xe9xico, agrees. \u201cIn Venezuela, we normalized racist vocabulary. We normalized it as a way to joke around, but when anyone thinks that black people do something bad, the words are derogatory. White people were of course offended when someone gave them nicknames, anyone would. But how many of them wouldn\u2019t be allowed inside a nightclub because of the color of their skin?\u201d</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Leo knows very well why he uses that example. In January, 2017, his social media was on fire after he wrote about how he was denied entry to a nightclub in eastern Caracas\u2019s because of the color of his skin. \u201cSince I\u2019m a musician, I\u2019ve always moved within the nightclub circuit. I\u2019d always hear cases of black people being denied access to nightclubs, everyone in Caracas has heard those stories. They didn\u2019t care that I was a musician and that a lot of people inside that nightclub knew me, I was told I wasn\u2019t going in.\u201d</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">At the time, his story went viral and sparked the debate about racism in Venezuela. A type of discrimination that joins others, such as xenophobia and classism.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">That\u2019s the way Alejandro sees it, with brown skin, black hair, and brown eyes, Venezuelan by birth but a Colombian national, too. \u201cMy parents came to Venezuela in the late \u201870s, when the country boasted a strong economy. My uncle tells me that once, as he waited in line at his school, one of the teachers told another, with the full intention of him hearing it, that they had to be careful with the \u2018</span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">caliches</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\u2019, because they could rob them.\u201d</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Discrimination was always present, especially with the clich\xe9s that were built around Colombians: all Colombians were </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">narcos</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, all Colombians were thieves and liars. \u201cOnce at school, I was told I must be a </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">narco</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> because my parents were Colombian. Obviously those things hurt a 12-year-old. In my house, we were careful not to tell anyone that we were going on vacation to Colombia, to avoid barbaric comments,\u201d Alejandro says. He\u2019s currently living in Bogot\xe1.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Yet living in the Colombian capital, Alejandro has had to face another type of discrimination: being Venezuelan. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated topic. In the Colombian coast I haven\u2019t felt that much discrimination, but I\u2019ve felt it in Bogot\xe1. Saying that racism or any other kind of discrimination doesn\u2019t exist in Venezuela, is living in a bubble. And now, many Venezuelans who have migrated, have to experience it themselves.\u201d</span></p>\\n<blockquote><p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">I knew right away that I wouldn\u2019t be hired. She asked me several questions, but they all focused on the typical Venezuelan clich\xe9s about black people.</span></p></blockquote>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Pedro has the same feeling. While he was born in Ecuador, he moved to Caracas with his family when he was six. He\u2019s back in Ecuador now, in Riobamba. \u201cIn Caracas people would call me </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">cotorro,</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> or ignorant Indian. At school I was always the strange one because I didn\u2019t look like any of my peers. Now that I\u2019m back in my home country, I\u2019m the </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">veneco.</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\u201d</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Pedro\u2019s family stood out for having several clothing stores in Propatria, Caracas, and most of the times he went with his father to tend to one of them, he came home with a story to tell. \u201cI remember a lady came in to buy a shirt. Since she didn\u2019t like the price because she thought it was too expensive, she began screaming how they could let \u2018these Indians\u2019 into Venezuela. The fuss was so big, that even the police came in. After that my dad didn\u2019t want me to go to the stores that much.\u201d</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Pedro still makes a living from the family business of selling clothes, and his two daughters have graduated from university. \u201cHalfway through Law school, a teacher told one of them not to worry too much about finishing because Indians would never be lawyers. When she told me that, I went to the school and made a complaint, and while it was written on his record, the teacher kept his job. We can\u2019t say that in our country, because Venezuela is also my country, there\u2019s no discrimination.\u201d</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As I registered these testimonies, I also recalled two stories. One of them happened while I was studying at the university, doing a group assignment at a classmate\u2019s house. Her mother offered us a chocolate beverage and when she brought them, she told me: \u201cIt\u2019s really black, just like you.\u201d She didn\u2019t say it as a joke; her tone was full of scorn.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Then, one day when I was walking on the sidewalk near our home in Quinta Crespo, my mother and I were almost run over by a car that went on the sidewalk. When my mother complained, he just said: \u201cCome on, </span><i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">cotorrita</span></i><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, keep walking.\u201d My mother is Ecuadorian by birth, but has been living in Venezuela for over 40 years.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In an interview with Milagros Socorro, anthropologist and writer Michaelle Ascencio, Venezuelan with Haitian roots, said: \u201cRacism in Venezuela is an attitude towards certain people based on their physical features; and many times, in Venezuela, that attitude is rejection. But since the 19th century, the rhetoric has been determined in denying tensions between the groups that make up Venezuelan society, and since local racism isn\u2019t like the one in the United States, for example, it has served as a route for denial. In Venezuela, people don\u2019t get killed because they\u2019re black, and that\u2019s the extreme bar used to minimize the violence that we live in.\u201d</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">These six testimonies confirm what Ascencio said: there&#8217;s subtle racism in our country, and subtlety might minimize discrimination, but it\u2019ll never hide it.</span></p>\\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the wave of social protests in the U.S., the conversation about racism in Venezuela has re-emerged.

On Wednesday, 231 new cases were registered (local infection: 159, &#8220;imported&#8221;: 72), the total is now 3,386 and 28 deaths. A 41-year-old patient died, a nurse from Los Frailes de Catia, in Caracas. Local cases tripled in a day. With that, the official statement of the borders being the only dangerous area is over.

Everything is under control (the nonexistent flattened curve); 2. Borders are the only risk (returning migrants are to blame); 3. There\u2019s a \u201cmore aggressive strain\u201d in Zulia. The early quarantine coincided with the worst part of fuel shortage, and flexibilizing the quarantine affected only the formal sector of the economy. We\u2019ve all seen people on the streets that don\u2019t even use masks. Every update has been an excuse for political agenda and figures were underestimated. The citizens\u2019s disregard for the rules is similar to how chavismo has narrated the problem. Today, in Venezuela, there isn\u2019t a hospital which has, at the same time, biosafety gear, medical supplies, sanitary supplies, electricity and water. Not one. Deputy Jos\xe9 Manuel Olivares, who\u2019s in exile in Colombia, wrote last night: \u201cThe number of deaths not accounted for grows every day,\u201d and mentioned the example of the death of former chief of Maracaibo\u2019s University Hospital on Tuesday.\xa0</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The most recent TSJ rulings against Acci\xf3n Democr\xe1tica and Primero Justicia, reunited the opposition block on Wednesday.

The caretaker government is recognized by the world, it won\u2019t be\xa0 any different with the continuity of the National Assembly, the dictatorship will fall and the republic will prevail,\u201d said Guaid\xf3. He encouraged the public to turn unrest into mobilitazions, emphasizing the need for protection against COVID-19 and he recognized the despair, he asked the nation to work together: \u201cIt isn\u2019t only about resisting, it\u2019s also about fighting (&#8230;) we must exercise that right.\u201d\xa0</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">On Wednesday, deputy Chaim Bucar\xe1n asked the TSJ to suspend Un Nuevo Tiempo\u2019s current board and appoint him as president of the party. \u201cWe requested the presidency of the party,\u201d said Bucar\xe1n. If his request is accepted, it would be the third party in a week over which authorities are imposed by the TSJ. In order to increase their number of attacks over democratic institutions, the ANC reverted yesterday a decree they issued in December 2017, when they modified the Law of Political Parties, with the TSJ\u2019s blessing, forcing parties to validate before the National Electoral Council.

That\u2019s how the parties the TSJ intervened will be able to participate with their chavista authorities even though they have no voters. Cabello said that political parties with criminal charges won\u2019t be able to participate in elections.

The collapse was commented on social media, because UCV transcends its alumni. It\u2019s, in fact, everyone\u2019s patrimony.
